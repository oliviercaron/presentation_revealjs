## Context During the COVID-19 Pandemic

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the global demand for a vaccine created
immense public and market pressure.\
- **Massive market potential**: global market in need of billions of doses => **high R&D costs**.\
- **Accelerated regulatory processes**: Agencies like the **EMA** fast-tracked approval procedures to respond to the crisis.\
- **Intense competition**: A race to develop the first vaccine to secure **first mover advantage**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Problem and Objectives

**Problem:** How do pharmaceutial preannouncements impact public
reaction during COVID-19?\
**Objectives:**\
1. Explore public reactions using Twitter data.\
2. Analyze sentiment variations and side effects mentions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Theoretical Framework

-   **Signaling theory** explains how companies use signals to reduce
    uncertainty in markets with high stakes and information asymmetry
    (Spence, 1973; Akerlof, 1978; Eliashberg & Robertson, 1988).\
-   **Preannouncements** serve a dual role:
    1.  Inform regulators to build trust and smooth approval processes.\
    2.  Influence competitors and the public to secure a competitive
        edge.
-   **Negativity bias** suggests that negative signals (e.g., side effects)
    often dominate public discourse more than positive ones (Baumeister
    et al., 2001).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hypotheses

We hypothesize that:\
1. **Asymmetry in Signals:** Positive signals (e.g., high efficacy) will
generate positive sentiment, while negative signals (e.g., side effects)
will generate stronger negative reactions.\
2. **Backlash Effect:** Sentiment initially aligns with the direction of the signal (positive
 or negative) but subsequently reverses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methodology Overview

We analyzed **French-language tweets** (2020-2021) mentioning major
pharmaceutical companies authorized to market a COVID-19 vaccine in
France:\
- **Pfizer/BioNTech**, **Moderna**, **AstraZeneca**, **Sanofi**,
**Johnson & Johnson**.\
Using **regular expressions** to detect mentions, we focus on
**Pfizer**, **Moderna**, and **AstraZeneca** due to their larger
presence in discourse.\
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** We used **GLiNER** (Zaratiana et
al., 2024) to extract side effects.\
- **Sentiment Analysis:** We used **XLM-RoBERTa**, a transformer-based
model fine-tuned on multilingual tweets (Barbieri et al., 2021), to
classify tweets into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results: Side Effects in Public Reaction

Public reaction to **side effects** significantly impacts perceptions of
vaccine safety.

## Results: Public Sentiment AstraZeneca

## Discussion

- Negative signals overshadow positives (negativity bias).  
- Strong brand leadership attracts both attention and scrutiny.  
- Crisis communication is vital to mitigate reputational damage.  
- Preannouncements are double-edged: they show progress but invite closer public monitoring.

::: notes
“Overall, we see that while preannouncements initially boost positive sentiment—especially for Pfizer and Moderna—negative signals soon dominate, illustrating a clear negativity bias. 
AstraZeneca stands out with high negativity from the start, largely due to concerns over side effects and regulatory suspensions. 
This shows how strong brand leadership draws heavier scrutiny, making crisis communication essential to manage reputational risks. 
Finally, preannouncements can demonstrate progress but also invite closer public monitoring, amplifying both positive and negative reactions.”

## Future Research Directions

- Investigate how signals affect long-term trust and brand perception.  
- Examine social media sentiment’s impact on regulatory decisions.  
- Segment populations (media, health professionals, politics, etc.) to identify within-segment variations.  
- Use LLMs to clarify genuine brand targeting vs. incidental mention and more nuanced sentiment analysis.  
- Implement social listening for agencies (EMA, ANSM, etc.) to quickly detect side effects and complement official reports.
