# 1. Definition and Importance of Systematic Literature Reviews

## What Is a Systematic Literature Review?
- **Systematic**: A structured, replicable, and transparent process for collecting and analyzing literature on a specific topic.
- **Literature Review**: Synthesis of existing research to identify:
  - Key themes
  - Research gaps
  - Future research directions

. . .

## Why Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?
- **Credibility and Transparency**: Minimizes bias, promotes replicability.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensures all relevant studies are included.
- **Guides Future Research**: Highlights gaps and emerging areas of study.

# 2. SLR Process & PRISMA Framework

## Standard Steps in an SLR
1. **Define Research Question** (PICO, PICOC, etc., in medical or social sciences)
2. **Search Strategy** (databases, keywords, boolean operators)
3. **Screening & Eligibility** (inclusion/exclusion criteria)
4. **Quality Assessment** (methodological soundness, relevance)
5. **Data Extraction** (collect relevant information)
6. **Synthesis & Analysis** (qualitative or quantitative/meta-analysis)
7. **Reporting** (PRISMA flow diagram, structured write-up)

. . .

## PRISMA Flow Diagram (Briefly)
- **Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)**:
  - Structured approach to document how many articles were found, screened, included, or excluded at each step.
  - Ensures transparency in the selection of articles.

# 3. AI & NLP in Literature Reviews

## Where Does AI/NLP Fit In?
- **Automated Text Mining**: Quickly processes large volumes of abstracts and full texts.
- **Topic Modeling** (e.g., BERTopic, LDA): Identifies thematic structures from textual data.
- **Clustering & Network Analysis**: Helps visualize relationships between authors, topics, and keywords.
- **Summarization**: AI-driven tools to extract key points, saving time on manual reading.

. . .

## Example: NLP in Marketing Research
- **Data Collection**: 
  - Used Scopus API to retrieve all relevant abstracts and author information.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Cleaned text data (removing stopwords, punctuation).
  - Used graphing libraries to visualize co-authorship networks and keyword co-occurrences.
  - Applied **BERTopic** for advanced topic modeling.
- **Insights**:
  - Identified main research clusters, key authors, and emerging topics in marketing.

# 4. Tools & Demonstration

## Traditional vs. AI-Enhanced Tools
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
**Traditional Tools**
- **R bibliometrix**  
  - Free, open-source R package for bibliometric analysis.
  - Offers citation analysis, co-occurrence networks, and more.
- **VOSviewer**  
  - Free software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks.
  - Widely used in academic reviews.
:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
**AI-Enhanced Tools**
- **Artirev**, **Connected Papers**, **Elicit**, **AnswerThis**, **ResearchRabbit**, **LitMaps**
  - Provide intelligent recommendations.
  - Map out how papers connect based on citations or semantic similarity.
  - Some are free or freemium, some have advanced paid features.

## Quick Demonstration: R bibliometrix
```{r}
# NOTE: Comments are written in English

# Install and load bibliometrix (if not already installed)
# install.packages("bibliometrix")
library(bibliometrix)

# Import data (e.g., a set of Scopus-exported records in a .bib file)
# data <- convert2df("path_to_scopus_export.bib", dbsource = "scopus", format = "bibtex")

# Perform a brief bibliometric analysis
# results <- biblioAnalysis(data, sep = ";")

# Summary of the main information
# summary(results)

# Visualize co-citation network (example)
# network <- biblioNetwork(data, analysis = "co-citation", network = "references", sep = ";")
# networkPlot(network, type = "fruchterman", size = TRUE)
```
