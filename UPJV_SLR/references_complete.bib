  abstract = {Textual information is becoming available in abundance on the web, arising the requirement of techniques and tools to extract the meaningful information. One of such an important information extraction task is Named Entity Recognition and Classification. It is the problem of finding the members of various predetermined classes, such as person, organization, location, date/time, quantities, numbers etc. The concept of named entity extraction was first proposed in Sixth Message Understanding Conference in 1996. Since then, a number of techniques have been developed by many researchers for extracting diversity of entities from different languages and genres of text. Still, there is a growing interest among research community to develop more new approaches to extract diverse named entities which are helpful in various natural language applications. Here we present a survey of developments and progresses made in Named Entity Recognition and Classification research.},

  abstract = {The increasing importance and proliferation of text data provide a unique opportunity and novel lens to study human communication across a myriad of business and marketing applications. For example, consumers compare and review products online, individuals interact with their voice assistants to search, shop, and express their needs, investors seek to extract signals from firms' press releases to improve their investment decisions, and firms analyze sales call transcripts to increase customer satisfaction and conversions. However, extracting meaningful information from unstructured text data is a nontrivial task. In this chapter, we review established natural language processing (NLP) methods for traditional tasks (e.g., LDA for topic modeling and lexicons for sentiment analysis and writing style extraction) and provide an outlook into the future of NLP in marketing, covering recent embedding-based approaches, pretrained language models, and transfer learning for novel tasks such as automated text generation and multi-modal representation learning. These emerging approaches allow the field to improve its ability to perform certain tasks that we have been using for more than a decade (e.g., text classification). But more importantly, they unlock entirely new types of tasks that bring about novel research opportunities (e.g., text summarization, and generative question answering). We conclude with a roadmap and research agenda for promising NLP applications in marketing and provide supplementary code examples to help interested scholars to explore opportunities related to NLP in marketing.},

However, it is unclear what the meaning of Named Entity is, and yet there is a general belief that Named Entity Recognition is a solved task. In this paper we analyze the evolution of the field from a theoretical and practical point of view. We argue that the task is actually far from solved and show the consequences for the development and evaluation of tools. We discuss topics for further research with the goal of bringing the task back to the research scenario.},

  abstract = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. Traditional NER models are effective but limited to a set of predefined entity types. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) can extract arbitrary entities through natural language instructions, offering greater flexibility. However, their size and cost, particularly for those accessed via APIs like ChatGPT, make them impractical in resource-limited scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a compact NER model trained to identify any type of entity. Leveraging a bidirectional transformer encoder, our model, GLiNER, facilitates parallel entity extraction, an advantage over the slow sequential token generation of LLMs. Through comprehensive testing, GLiNER demonstrate strong perfor:m  ann  ce, no  utperfr orming b]  oth) )C  hat)-  GPT and fine-tuned LLMs in zero-shot evaluations on various NER benchmarks.},
