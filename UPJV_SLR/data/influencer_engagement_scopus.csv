Utilizing a comprehensive survey and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, we unveil a model where CSR, as a key influencer, drives e-WOM through consumer motivation and admiration, with green altruism serving as a significant moderator. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of genuine CSR communication in enhancing consumer engagement and e-WOM, indicating that strategic digital CSR efforts can foster customer loyalty and advocacy. While our research primarily addresses China’s hospitality sector, the implications extend globally, offering valuable insights for businesses aiming to understand and leverage consumer behavior in the digital era. This pioneering work in CSR and e-WOM serves as a guide for contemporary firms navigating the complexities of digital consumer dynamics. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cognitions; consumer decision making;

With a practical focus, this study aims at helping marketers cope with the challenge by developing conceptual typologies for influencers and followers and suggesting marketing implications for each type of influencer and follower. Design/methodology/approach: This study subscribes to the perspectives of virtual community and social information processing to develop conceptual typologies for influencers and followers based on their essential characteristics. Findings: Based on levels of expertise and interactivity, influencers can be categorized as broadcasters, leaders, friends and companions. Each type has advantages in certain branding objectives (e.g. increasing awareness, inducing judgments and feelings, building brand and user imagery, encouraging pro-brand behaviors and managing relationships) and is associated with certain marketing limitations (e.g. reach, domain breadth, informational support, brand congruence and relationship management). Based on levels of behavioral engagement and the point of attachment, followers are categorized into spectators, participants, admirers and advocators, with specific marketing communication strategies most effective for each type (e.g. strategies of content, narratives, engagement and co-branding).

Content Marketing can only be successful if content is in some way of value to the targeted audience. To increase the likelihood for this to occur, the audience must be clearly defined so that content can be created to match or fit with the target group’s interests. Importantly, content marketing is not the same as advertising - therefore, its focus should be on the benefits that campaigns with each individual piece of content offer. Content signals brand personality and values, and thus shapes stakeholders’ views of its sender. It is thus crucial that marketers create a clear branding guide for employees and external partners involved in content creation and delivery to ensure quality and consistency of their content marketing outputs. Planning is an essential element of developing a content marketing strategy. Marketers should not engage in producing and distributing any content without having defined SMART objectives. Also, content to be shared with their audiences must be created and delivered strategically and be an integrated part of the overall marketing plan. Planning also includes selecting a set of appropriate metrics to monitor and evaluate content performance. Content creation requires creativity. Effective content marketing puts content ideation at its core, developing creative outputs that respond to the brief. As consistently developing innovative and creative ideas is challenging, tools such as reflective diaries or brainstorming sessions can be useful to foster creativity. One pathway towards effective content marketing practice is through the provision of value through informative content. Elicitation of value through informative content can help organisations stimulate positive customer engagement behaviours on social media, have a positive impact on brand perceptions, improve brand health, and help raise brand awareness. Content creators should evaluate the educational value of their content and ensure that the content’s main topic is related to the brand values and ethos. Expert knowledge or areas of expertise an organisation or individual can draw on are a very good basis for the creation of informative content. Providing audiences with content that has entertainment benefits can stimulate brand-related interactions and help brands communicate their personality. Branded entertainment content should always focus on providing entertainment while the branded message should only be embedded very subtly. Where appropriate, brands can use humour in their content marketing practice; this can help the message to become more relatable and engaging. Given the visual nature of most social media platforms, it is important to use high quality visuals as they can also foster engagement and improve a brand’s reputation. Also, embedding social value in content marketing can positively impact consumer satisfaction, trust, brand reputation, and loyalty. Marketers can create social value through digital content that stimulates interactions between brands and consumers as well as other consumers in the social media settings. Relational content helps brands to foster socialisation, improve brand experience, and build strong and long-lasting relationships with targeted audiences. The more interactions marketers can stimulate via content, the greater the chances for building strong online brand communities - which should be a goal of any digital marketer. Brands should engage in activities that embrace co-creation and inspire the creation of user-generated content (UGC). UGC is particularly suited to stimulate engagement and increase reach. People tend to trust other people over brands, therefore, UGC content can be a great way to improve trust and convince users. However, marketers need to clearly define their UGC campaigns so that the developed content corresponds with brand values and marketing goals. It is crucial for marketers to always acknowledge UGC creators and thank them in an appropriate form for their content. Using social media influencers to create or disseminate content is a great way to generate user engagement, increase trust, and boost online reach. As there are many types of influencers, organisations need to make sure that they select the influencer who is appropriate for their content marketing goals. When deciding about which influencers to collaborate with, marketers should be guided by the following criteria: influencer’s reach, engagement rate, authenticity, trustworthiness, content and audience quality, and values. To effectively engage online audiences, brands should aim to post content regularly. However, constant creation of new content can be costly and time consuming. Rather than solely focusing on own content, marketers can also embrace content curation and adapt existing content from third party sources to the brand’s messaging. When engaging in content curation, it is crucial for the marketer to make sure that the curated content comes from a reputable source, and that it is relevant to the target audience. Content marketing can be of particular value when used in conjunction with sponsorship and as a means of leveraging the sponsor-sponsee relationship throughout contract duration. Also here, the provision of value to fans and brand-related communities is key; whereby symbolic, and social benefits have been identified as particularly effective in terms of driving positive audience responses. A focus on mid- to long-term brand shaping, assuming a fan- and audiences-based perspective, a co-creative approach, and integrating sponsorship and leveraging within the broader marketing mix are additional important principles for content marketing in sponsorship contexts. Marketers should practice ethical content marketing. This includes aspects such as ensuring to disclose sponsorships or compensations schemes, maintaining sincerity and honesty in their practice, and always fact-check every piece of content to make sure that the dissented information is accurate. Furthermore, the marketer should avoid harm to vulnerable groups, maintain professional standards, adequately recompense influencers, be respectful, loyal, and socially responsible. As the digital environment is under the state of constant development, content creators need to make sure that they stay up to date with the latest trends and technological advancements. AI-generated content can be a powerful tool for creating engaging and relevant content for the target audience. Similarly, embracing the augmented reality and virtual reality formats can help to effectively engage key audiences and spark third-party publication. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Agata Krowinska, Christof Backhaus, Benjamin Becker and Fabian Bosser; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-100098753-9; 978-103238737-6","","","English","Digital Content Marketing: Creating Value in Practice","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179296137"

Green influencers (also: greenfluencers or sustainable influencers) are considered a key agent for a change to more sustainable consumption. A pilot field study of 1000 green influencers, however, indicates that the current communication practices of green influencers (which strongly focus on gain frames, low construal, and posts during the week) are not ideal for maximizing engagement and sustainable behavioral intentions. Two experiments replicate this finding and establish the process through which green influencer posts affect engagement: gain frames increase fluency, which increases engagement; low construal levels decrease psychological distance, which increases engagement. Timing moderates these processes in that weekend posts increase the engagement with gain frames and week posts increase the engagement with low-construal frames. These findings highlight that there is no silver bullet in green influencer messages, but that green influencers need to adapt the framing and construal of their messages to the posts' timing to increase their contribution to more sustainable lifestyles and the greater good. © 2024 The Authors.

However, even though influencer marketing is a craze in the market, the engagement rate and conversion rates of micro-influencers with a smaller size of followers are higher than that of celebrities and mega influencers. It is important to understand the reasons why certain influencers are successful and others are not. Past research mainly focuses on micro-influencers as one group but does not differentiate between micro-influencers who are known personally by their followers and those who are not personally known. This is important as consumers are sceptical towards the product promotion not only of mega-influencers because they believe that influencers, in general, are using their base of followers to promote a product or service for money and fame. Therefore, consumers trust the words and opinions of micro-influencers, who provide information based on their own experience and expertise. It is worth investigating the underlying reason for the success of these micro and nano influencers. Is it the personal connection with the follower? Is it the engagement rate and the choice of products and recommendations? These are some of the points that have been investigated in this research. The objective of this research paper was to explore if followers who share a relationship with or know the micro-influencers personally make their purchase decisions based on the recommendations provided by the influencers. The research findings highlighted that when micro-influencers are known to their followers on a personal level, they wield more persuasive power over their followers. © 2023 Oxbridge Publishing House Ltd UK","consumer behaviour; digital marketing; influencer marketing; marketing; micro-influencer; social media marketing","","","","","","","","AlAnezi M., Almutairy M., Influencer Engagement Rate Under Scalable Machine Learning Approaches, Social Computing and Social Media: Applications in Marketing, Learning, and Health, pp. 3-14, (2021); Amos C., Holmes G., Strutton D., Exploring the relationship between celebrity endorser effects and advertising effectiveness: A quantitative synthesis of effect size, Internationaljournal of advertising, 27, 2, pp. 209-234, (2008); Belk R.

Influencer marketing is successful because of its diversity, innovation, and proximity to customers. Nevertheless, previous research has not shown a connection between the various facets of brand participation. The purpose of this study was to determine how the credibility, competence, content, interaction, lifestyle, and brand congruence of influencers affect cognitive, emotional, and behavioural brand engagement and lead to increased purchase intention. An online questionnaire was used to gather data, and it was circulated across various online platforms and social media platforms. The data was then analysed using the structural equation model (SEM). According to the research, there is a number of factors that help to grow the followers’ brand engagement with influencers. These factors include credibility, knowledge, content, interaction, lifestyle, and brand congruence. In addition to that, the practical and theoretical ramifications of the results are discussed in this paper.

Once a business quantifies this value, LTV informs decisions ranging from how much to spend on acquisition and engagement campaigns to how much to expend on customer service and retention efforts. In this paper, current philosophies and measurement approaches used to calculate customer LTV are briefly reviewed and an evolution of the LTV framework that incorporates omnichannel customer engagement is recommended. While current LTV inputs rely mostly on first party data such as website behaviour, e-mail open and click-through rates and paid media engagement, the value of a customer-brand relationship extends beyond interaction with owned and paid media channels. The framework proposed in this paper provides practitioners with a new approach to evaluate customer value that additionally provides insight into a new segment of potential influencer and affiliate partners and suggests that the value of customers may extend beyond their spend with a brand to include their impact on other customers’ spend. © 2024, Henry Stewart Publications.

This study examines the influence of IMC strategies on students’ choices of higher education institutions (HEIs) in Bangalore, India. Using a descriptive research design, data were gathered via a structured questionnaire from a sample of 384 students. The findings reveal notable disparities in perceptions of IMC based on gender, academic discipline preference, and institution type. Interestingly, age does not yield significant differences in IMC perceptions. A positive correlation (0.632) between IMC perceptions and choice of HEIs underscores the importance of customized strategies in attracting and engaging students. IMC strategies such as digital marketing, social media engagement, content marketing, alumni engagement, and student ambassadors significantly influence the choice of HEIs with the variance of 0.315, 0.523, 0.394, 0.619, and 0.298, respectively. Further, IMC strategies such as digital marketing, social media engagement, alumni engagement, partnership with influencers, and student ambassadors significantly influence the selection of disciplines with the variance of 0.298, 0.642, 0.497, 0.421, and 0.234, respectively. In essence, this study emphasizes the pivotal role of effective IMC strategies in higher education choice decision-making and provides actionable insights for institutions seeking to refine their marketing approaches. © Saumi Roy, Sheelan Misra, 2024.","educational institutions; higher education; integrated marketing communication; strategies","","","","","","","","Lasi Abdul, Bin M., Rahim R.

However, as social media platforms are not highly regulated, it has given rise to mass amounts of health misinformation. Many unqualified people, typically social media influencers, are profiting from sharing nonevidence- based messages and qualified health professionals are unable to match their audience engagement. However, social media also holds the potential to be used to promote evidence-based messages to large audiences and contribute to positive change within society. The application of machine learning and natural language processing techniques to understand social media data is common, with increasing health research applications. There are many challenges and opportunities for health as the world progresses through the digital era.

This research investigates the impact of SMIs homophily in developing customer brand engagement (CBE) and its impact on BL. We collected valid data from 412 respondents using laptop brands in Pakistan and used structural equation modeling to analyze the data. The findings indicate that the SMIs homophily is crucial in establishing CBE and BL. The results further show that CBE’s emotional and cognitive dimensions significantly mediate the relationship between SMIs homophily and BL. However, the emotional CBE has a stronger mediating impact on BL. The study provides valuable insights for brand managers to hire SMIs who resemble their fans to grab their loyalty toward the brand. This study unfolds new avenues in social media marketing, consumer behavior, and branding literature by understanding the association between SMIs homophily, CBE, and BL. © 2024 Korean Scholars of Marketing Science.","consumer loyalty; homophily; loyalty; non-behavioral customer engagement; Social media influencers","","","","","","","","Ahmed R.U., Social media marketing, shoppers’ store love and loyalty, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 40, 2, pp. 153-168, (2022); Akhtar N., Islam T., Unveiling the predictors and outcomes of TikTok addiction: The moderating role of parasocial relationships, (2023); Alboqami H., Trust me, I’m an influencer! - Causal recipes for customer trust in artificial intelligence influencers in the retail industry, Journal of Retailing & Consumer Services, 72, (2023); Algharabat R., Rana N.P., Alalwan A.A., Baabdullah A., Gupta A., Investigating the antecedents of customer brand engagement and consumer-based brand equity in social media, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 53, (2020); Aljuhmani H.Y., Elrehail H., Bayram P., Samarah T., Linking social media marketing efforts with customer brand engagement in driving brand loyalty, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing & Logistics, 35, 7, pp. 1719-1738, (2023); Beam E.A., Social media as a recruitment and data collection tool: Experimental evidence on the relative effectiveness of web surveys and chatbots, Journal of Development Economics, 162, (2023); Bu Y., Parkinson J., Thaichon P., Influencer marketing: Homophily, customer value co-creation behaviour and purchase intention, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 66, (2022); Chakraborty U., Biswal S.K., Is digital social communication effective for social relationship?

Findings: This study reveals that influencers’ personal self-disclosure has a positive impact on followers’ parasocial relationships with them and online engagement with their content. Interestingly, the results indicate an inverted U-shaped relationship between influencers’ professional self-disclosure and followers’ parasocial relationships, as well as online engagement with the influencers’ content. Furthermore, followers’ parasocial relationships and engagement partially mediate the impact of influencers’ personal and professional self-disclosure on followers’ purchase intentions. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the literature by revealing the underlying mechanisms of the differential effects of influencers’ personal and professional self-disclosure on followers’ purchase intentions. Practical implications: The findings will assist marketers in leveraging influencer-generated content to enhance influencer marketing effectiveness. Originality/value: This research provides a better understanding of the potential linear and nonlinear effects of influencers’ self-disclosure on followers’ parasocial relationships and engagement in social media marketing. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Engagement; Influencer marketing; Parasocial relationship; Purchase intention; Self-disclosure","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72102089); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72102089).","Agnihotri D., Chaturvedi P., Kulshreshtha K., Tripathi V., Investigating the impact of authenticity of social media influencers on followers’ purchase behavior: mediating analysis of parasocial interaction on Instagram, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 35, 10, pp. 2377-2394, (2023); Altman I., Taylor D.A., Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, (1973); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Guidry Moulard J., Authenticity under threat: when social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Aw E.C.X., Chuah S.H.W., ‘Stop the unattainable ideal for an ordinary me!’ fostering parasocial relationships with social media influencers: the role of self-discrepancy, Journal of Business Research, 132, pp. 146-157, (2021); Beichert M., Bayerl A., Goldenberg J., Lanz A., Revenue generation through influencer marketing, Journal of Marketing, 88, 4, pp. 40-63, (2024); Blau P.M., Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Boerman S.C., The effects of the standardized Instagram disclosure for micro-and meso-influencers, Computers in Human Behavior, 103, pp. 199-207, (2020); Bond S.D., He S.X., Wen W., Speaking for ‘free’: word of mouth in free-and paid-product settings, Journal of Marketing Research, 56, 2, pp. 276-290, (2019); Bozkurt S., Gligor D.M., Babin B.J., The role of perceived firm social media interactivity in facilitating customer engagement behaviors, European Journal of Marketing, 55, 4, pp. 995-1022, (2021); Carpenter A., Greene K., Social penetration theory, The International Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Communication, pp. 1-4, (2015); Chae I., Bruno H.A., Feinberg F.M., Wearout or weariness?

However, the current managerially relevant question for direct-to-consumer firms of whether to target low- or high-followership influencers to generate immediate revenue is still unresolved. In this article, the authors’ goal is to answer this question by considering for the first time the whole influencer-marketing funnel, that is, from followers on user-generated content networks (e.g., on Instagram), to reached followers, to engagement, to actual revenue, while accounting for the cost of paid endorsements. The authors find that low-followership targeting outperforms high-followership targeting by order of magnitude across three performance (return on investment) metrics. A mediation analysis reveals that engagement can explain the negative relationship between the influencer followership levels and return on investment. This is in line with the rationale based on social capital theory that with higher followership levels of an influencer, the engagement between an influencer and their followers decreases. These two findings are derived from secondary sales data of 1,881,533 purchases and results of three full-fledged field studies with hundreds of paid influencer endorsements, establishing the robustness of the findings. © The Author(s) 2024.","creator economy; influencer marketing; paid endorsements; ROI; sales; social media; user-generated content networks","","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; IDEUM; Higher Education Commission, Pakistan, HEC; Julius Paul Stiegler Memorial Foundation; Labex, (Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047)","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Julius Paul Stiegler Memorial Foundation, IDEUM, HEC Paris in Qatar, and a grant from the French National Research Agency (ANR), \u201CInvestissements d\u2019Avenir\u201D (LabEx Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047).

However, little research explores how sponsored videos’ design strategies affect viewer engagement. Using field data, this study highlights influencers’ authenticity dilemma in sponsored video design and tests which features drive digital engagement. Specifically, this study conceptualizes and empirically tests a comprehensive framework, involving passion- and transparency-based strategies as well as platform- and brand-factors, to determine how influencers can best manage the authenticity dilemma. Results show that explicitly disclosing brand sponsorship, alone, and in combination with platform-generated disclosure, positively impacts digital engagement, indicating an evolution in consumer persuasion knowledge. Early brand appearance, high video customization, and influencers’ subjective endorsements, such as sharing personal experiences or opinions about the sponsored product, impair sponsored videos’ digital engagement. In addition to contributing theoretical insights on authenticity management strategies and sponsorship disclosure in influencer videos, this research offers practical recommendations to influencers on how to design more engaging sponsored videos. © 2022, Academy of Marketing Science.","Authenticity; Digital engagement; Influencer marketing; Native advertising; Sponsored content; Sponsored videos; Vlogs","","","","","","Suffolk University","The authors thank the editor, associate editor, and review team for their clear and constructive feedback throughout the review process.

Importantly, TikTok’s algorithm is “hyperpersonalized,” increasing opportunities for parasocial relationships and word-of-mouth marketing on a level not seen elsewhere.

Naturally, many companies have leaned on human influencers, but the increasing popularity of pet influencers (e.g., dogs and cats) represents a new avenue for brand promotion. This research asks the question: Why and when are pet influencers preferrable to their human counterparts in terms of boosting engagement and purchase intention? Across six experimental studies (N = 1166), we demonstrate that pet influencers lead to higher engagement with the promoted content and willingness to buy the advertised product (Study 1) because they are seen as more credible than human influencers (Study 2). Pet influencers are perceived as cuter, which in turn positively affects their credibility (Study 3). Specifically, whimsicality is the cuteness dimension that explains their greater credibility (Study 4). These effects are stronger when the promoted product is pet-related (Study 5) and apply regardless of whether people own a pet (Studies 3–5). Finally, a clear cuteness manipulation supports the causal relationship between cuteness and credibility (Study 6). These findings affirm that pet influencers shape individuals' responses to promotional social media posts, enhance the field's understanding of the mechanisms that underlie influencer marketing effectiveness, and clarify how to implement more influential social media campaigns. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","credibility; cuteness; engagement; pet influencers; purchase intention","","","","","","","","Argo J.J., Dahl D.W., Manchanda R.V., The influence of a mere social presence in a retail context, Journal of Consumer Research, 32, 2, pp. 207-212, (2005); Argyris Y.A., Muqaddam A., Miller S., The effects of the visual presentation of an Influencer's Extroversion on perceived credibility and purchase intentions—moderated by personality matching with the audience, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 59, (2021); Argyris Y.A., Wang Z., Kim Y., Yin Z., The effects of visual congruence on increasing consumers' brand engagement: An empirical investigation of influencer marketing on Instagram using deep-learning algorithms for automatic image classification, Computers in Human Behavior, 112, (2020); Baklanov N., (2023); Balaji M.S., Jiang Y., Jha S., Nanoinfluencer marketing: How message features affect credibility and behavioral intentions, Journal of Business Research, 136, pp. 293-304, (2021); Belanche D., Casalo L.V., Flavian M., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Understanding influencer marketing: The role of congruence between influencers, products and consumers, Journal of Business Research, 132, pp. 186-195, (2021); Berry D.S., Brownlow S., Were the physiognomists right?

This research also investigates the moderation of brand familiarity on both focal aspects of trust (cognitive and affective), anthropomorphic cues and perceived authenticity. Design/methodology/approach: A mall-intercept survey approach was used to collect the responses using a structured survey from 377 respondents from India. The proposed model was tested using structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings indicate that physical and cognitive anthropomorphic features and perceived authenticity influence cognitive trust. However, affective trust is only influenced by perceived authenticity. Apart from this, higher levels of trust in VI contribute towards higher customer engagement and lead to sharing electronic word of mouth. Finally, brand familiarity moderates the relationship between emotional cues and affective trust. Practical implications: The popularity of VI is driving companies to redesign their marketing strategies. Due to the limitations of human influencers, companies are allocating budgets for VI-based marketing strategies. However, it is still unclear how consumers perceive VI as a brand endorser and what would be its implications. This study suggests that consumers are looking for anthropomorphic cues such as physical, cognitive and emotional cues of humanness in the VI, along with authentic content shared through them to instil their trust. Once the trust is built, consumers will be engaged and say positive things about VI. Originality/value: This study fills the gap by examining how anthropomorphic features and perceived authenticity contributed to both dimensions of trust (cognitive and affective), further enhancing customer engagement and electronic word of mouth. This research also examined the moderation of brand familiarity on the relationship between trust and its antecedents. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anthropomorphism; Customer engagement; E-WOM; Perceived authenticity; Trust; Virtual influencer","","","","","","","","Agag G., El-Masry A.A., Understanding consumer intention to participate in online travel community and effects on consumer intention to purchase travel online and WOM: an integration of innovation diffusion theory and TAM with trust, Computers in Human Behavior, 60, pp. 97-111, (2016); Agyei J., Sun S., Abrokwah E., Penney E.K., Ofori-Boafo R., Influence of trust on customer engagement: empirical evidence from the insurance industry in Ghana, Sage Open, 10, 1, (2020); Akhtar N., Hameed Z., Islam T., Pant M.K., Sharma A., Rather R.A., Kuzior A., Avatars of influence: understanding how virtual influencers trigger consumer engagement on online booking platforms, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 78, (2024); Allal-Cherif O., Puertas R., Carracedo P., Intelligent influencer marketing: how AI-powered virtual influencers outperform human influencers, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 200, (2024); Alnaim A.F., Sobaih A.E.E., Elshaer I.A., Measuring the mediating roles of e-trust and e-satisfaction in the relationship between e-service quality and e-loyalty: a structural modeling approach, Mathematics, 10, 13, (2022); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost human?

Although scholars have advocated a process view of customer engagement, they tend to accentuate unidirectional transitions from low- to high-engagement-level states. This constrains influencers’ understanding of customer engagement, which in turn inhibits their ability to both trigger profitable states of engagement as well as prevent deteriorating states of engagement from manifesting. To this end, we extend extant literature by conceptualizing customer engagement as an emergent process that embodies engagement states and engagement transitions. Empirically, we conduct an illustrative study in the context of entertainment live streaming and subscribe to the Markov chain method to showcase how customer engagement transition can be modeled. Based on 91,148 engagement records, we scrutinize the effects of influencers’ scheduling strategy on engagement transitions and viewers’ gratuities using the Multilevel Linear Model (MLM). Findings yield practical implications for influencers in terms of how live streaming sessions can be strategically scheduled to bolster customer engagement and monetization opportunities. © Academy of Marketing Science 2024.","Customer engagement; Emergent process; Engagement transition; Gratuity; Live streaming; Markov chain; Scheduling strategy","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72302121, 72332007, 72150610503); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; UIC Start-up Research Fund, (UICR0700105-24)","We would like to express our gratitude to the Guest Editor, Prof. V.

Research, however, has predominately explored key influencer marketing concepts, such as disclosure for native advertising from a consumer perspective. In addition, a review of the literature identifies other factors such as content cues and emotions, which may be important in providing a comprehensive understanding of influencer marketing. To address these gaps, this research adopted an exploratory research design using convergent interviews with the three key stakeholder groups consumers, influencers and brands. The findings reveal that beyond disclosure, other content cues within influencer marketing can contribute to advertising recognition. Further, from the perspective of brands, influencers are perceived to have unique credibility attributes relating to expertise on social media platforms and product categories. Emotional responses in influencer marketing are also shown to be predominately positive and directed towards influencers rather than brands, with potential for this to be transferred to the brand through emotional contagion. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","content cues;

Moreover, marketers acknowledge that podcast hosts are becoming trusted influencers with loyal communities, offering greater opportunity for consumer engagement and positive brand outcomes. This qualitative study examined open-ended survey responses associated with a 2 × 2 experimental study (N = 330) to investigate the degree to which podcast hosts cultivate trust, credibility, and authenticity with their audiences; as well as how parasocial relationships with podcast hosts ultimately influence listeners’ brand attitudes and behaviors.

Followers respond to virtual influencers much as if they were human, with engagement rates and measures of trust and source credibility that rival their human counterparts. However, there is an acute need for more nuanced understanding of the differential characteristics of user engagement with human influencers and the many emerging forms, types and interactional characteristics of virtual influencers. We conduct an exploratory study of three parts. First, through an indepth review of the existing literature, we delineate the implications of unsettled taxonomies of virtual influencers by function and form, and we outline a revised typology. Second, our secondary review of virtual influencer literature, trade, and industry sources conceptualizes divergent factors influencing the persuasive capability of human and virtual influencers while identifying intersecting research themes. From this synthesis we induce suggestions for future research and practice. Finally, we assess, refine and adjust our framework through depth interviews with leading expert practitioners to generate six key findings to guide future researched-backed virtual influencer practice and research. © 2024 The Author(s).

From the initial cooperation with the influencer, firms begin to create their own live-streaming channel, namely, the brands' self-built live-streaming. The purpose of this study is to explore the process of consumer engagement in the brands' self-built live-streaming. Design/methodology/approach: This research comprises two experimental studies. Study 1 examined the effect of streamer types (CEO vs. celebrity) on consumer engagement. Study 2 investigated the moderating effects of product innovativeness. Findings: Results showed that CEO streamers could enhance consumer engagement by increasing consumers' cognitive trust, and celebrity streamers could enhance consumer engagement by increasing consumers' emotional trust. In addition, consumer engagement was higher for really new products (vs. incremental new products) in CEO streamers' (vs. celebrity streamers') live-streaming. Originality/value: Compared with previous studies that focused on streamers based on the influencer marketing, this study expands the scope of research on the live-streaming ecosystem by exploring the effect of different streamer types on the brands' self-built live-streaming. By investigating consumer engagement, this study gives implications for the sustainable traffic issue in live-streaming e-commerce. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Celebrity; CEO; Consumer engagement; Live-streaming e-commerce; Product innovativeness; Streamer","","","","","","","","Agnihotri A., Bhattacharya S., The market value of celebrity endorsement evidence from India reveals factors that can influence stock-market returns, Journal of Advertising Research, 58, pp. 65-74, (2018); Aleti T., Pallant J.I., Tuan A., Van Laer T., Tweeting with the stars: automated text analysis of the effect of celebrity social media communications on consumer word of mouth, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 48, pp. 17-32, (2019); Bai L.-J., Yan X.-B., Yu G., Han Y., CEO media appearance and corporate performance: evidence from social media in China, 25th Annual International Conference on Management Science and Engineering 2018, 17-20 August 2018, pp. 441-447, (2018); Bi N.C., Zhang R.N., I will buy what my 'friend' recommends': the effects of parasocial relationships, influencer credibility and self-esteem on purchase intentions, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 17, pp. 157-175, (2023); Chen C., Hu Y.H., Lu Y.D., Hong Y.L., Everyone can be a star: quantifying grassroots online sellers' live streaming effects on product sales, Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 4493-4498, (2019); Chen T.Y., Yeh T.L., The impact of Internet celebrity characteristics on followers' impulse purchase behavior: the mediation of attachment and parasocial interaction, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 15, pp. 483-501, (2021); Chen H., Zhang S., Shao B., Gao W., Xu Y., How do interpersonal interaction factors affect buyers' purchase intention in live stream shopping?

Whilst some studies have explored the criteria of individual influencer types to engage consumer relationships, there is limited research which provides insights into sources of influence and impact for consumer brand engagement across a range of influencer types within the fashion retail industry. This chapter builds on the existing literature providing innovative insights by utilising the Source Credibility Theory to better understand what makes one influencer type more credible than another in their social media marketing campaigns for fashion brands. Ten semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of female millennial fashion consumers on Instagram to examine preferred influencers based on the 5 influencer types depicted in Campbell and Farrell (Business Horizons 63:469-479, 2020) framework. An engagement rate equation was first applied to fashion influencers’ Instagram posts to ascertain engagement rates for different influencer types. The interviews show that female millennials choose to follow influencers based on a number of the Source Credibility Theory constructs, with attractiveness, (likeability and reliability), as the most important construct, closely followed by expertise and trustworthiness. An interesting managerial implication is that whilst celebrity influencers have high follower counts and have been influential in traditional marketing advertising campaigns, their lack of online interaction with their followers means that engagement rates amongst consumers are lower-whilst in comparison, macro influencers, those with 100 k-1million followers, cost less to commission, and are much more impactful within the industry due to their higher engagement rates. Monitoring the source of credibility amongst different influencer types on social media platforms allows practitioners to expand their reach and positioning in the market more effectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Consumer brand engagement;

In this particular context, this research undertaking endeavors to delve into the intricacies and complexities inherently associated with the operation and management of a digital political marketing movement. Employing a case study methodology, this inquiry aims to thoroughly scrutinize successful strategies and potential challenges that may arise in this domain. Drawing upon the experiences of prominent Pakistani marketing campaigns, this paper meticulously examines the utilization of digital platforms in mobilizing supporters, disseminating messages, and engaging in targeted outreach. Furthermore, it seeks to explore the efficacy of various tactics that are employed, including but not limited to content creation, social media engagement, influencer marketing, and data-driven targeting. Additionally, this analysis considers Pakistan’s distinctive socio-political landscape, wherein cultural nuances, levels of digital literacy, and accessibility to the Internet play a pivotal role in shaping marketing campaign strategies. Moreover, addressing the ethical concerns that invariably accompany digital campaigning, such as spreading misinformation, privacy violations, and the proliferation of hate speech online, is imperative. By adopting a nuanced approach and providing a comprehensive understanding of both the opportunities and challenges inherent in running digital political marketing movements in Pakistan, this research endeavor aims to equip future marketing campaigns with invaluable insights and contribute to the broader discourse surrounding the role of digital technologies in shaping democratic processes. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","digital democracy; Digital political movement; election 2024; online political movement","","","","","","","","Abusleme C., Cracking the Political Code: The Case of e-Participation in Colombia, JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government, 12, 2, pp. 192-215, (2020); Adeney K., The Federal Election in Pakistan, February 2008, Electoral Studies, 28, 1, pp. 158-163, (2009); Ahmed I., Colonial Transformations, Postcolonial Afterlives: Extremism, Exclusion and Distrust in India and Pakistan, pp. 25-43, (2024); Akbar M., Religious Political Parties in Pakistan, pp. 169-180, (2024); Anderson J.E., Lee R.P., Tofighi M., Anderson S.T., Lobbying as a Potent Political Marketing Tool for Product Diversification: examining Firm-Government Interaction, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 31, 1, pp. 235-253, (2023); Andrianimanana F.M., Roca-Cuberes C., Blogging as Digital Citizen Participation: The Case of the Malagasy Diaspora, African Diaspora, 13, 1-2, pp. 119-138, (2021); Apriliyanti I.D., Kusumasari B., Pramusinto A., Setianto W.A., Digital Divide in ASEAN Member States: analyzing the Critical Factors for Successful e-Government Programs, Online Information Review, 45, 2, pp. 440-460, (2021); Bailo F., Online Communities and Crowds in the Rise of the Five Star Movement.”, (2020); Barisione M., Michailidou A., Airoldi M., Understanding a Digital Movement of Opinion: The Case of #RefugeesWelcome, Information Communication and Society, 22, 8, pp. 1145-1164, (2019); Begum I., General Election in Pakistan: A Critical Study, pp. 132-143, (2022); Birtchnell T., McGuirk P., Moore C., Vettoretto L., Pay to Play?

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a unique real-world data set that combines coded variables (e.g. customization) and objective video performance (e.g. sharing) of 365 sponsored videos to test the hypotheses. A negative binomial model is used to analyze the data set. Findings: This study finds that the effect of video customization on video shares varies across contexts. Video customization positively affects shares if they are made for well-established brands and high-involvement products but negatively influences shares if they are produced by mega and expert influencers. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the influencer marketing literature by focusing on a new media modality – sponsored video. Drawing on the multiple inference model and the persuasion knowledge theory, this study teases out different conditions under which video customization is more or less likely to foster audience engagement, which both influencers and brands care about. The chosen research setting may limit the generalizability of the findings of this study. Practical implications: The findings suggest that mega and expert influencers need to consider if their endorsement would backfire on a highly customized video. Brands that aim to engage customers with highly-customized videos should gauge their decision by taking into consideration their years of establishment and product involvement. For video-sharing platforms, especially those that are planning to expand their businesses to include “matching-making services” for brands and influencers, the findings provide theory-based guidance on optimizing such matches. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an urgent research need to study how brands and influencers should produce sponsored videos to achieve optimal outcomes. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Expert influencer; Influencer marketing; Mega influencer; Sponsored video; Sponsorship management; Video customization; Video sharing","","","","","","","","Akpinar E., Berger J., Valuable virality, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 2, pp. 318-330, (2017); Argyris Y.A., Muqaddam A., Miller S., The effects of the visual presentation of an influencer's extroversion on perceived credibility and purchase intentions—moderated by personality matching with the audience [article], Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 59, (2021); Arora A., Bansal S., Kandpal C., Aswani R., Dwivedi Y., Measuring social media influencer index-insights from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 49, pp. 86-101, (2019); Assael H., Kamins M.A., Effects of appeal type and involvement on product disconfirmation: a cognitive response approach through product trial, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 17, 3, pp. 197-207, (1989); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Moulard J.G., Authenticity under threat: when social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Balaji M.S., Jiang Y., Jha S., Nanoinfluencer marketing: How message features affect credibility and behavioral intentions [article], Journal of Business Research, 136, pp. 293-304, (2021); Barker S., Why is influencer marketing better than celebrity endorsements?

The primary objective is to uncover the underlying dynamics that influence consumer perceptions and behaviours in this unique market context. Design/methodology/approach: Using a quantitative method and purposing sampling, data were collected from 500 consumers of halal fashion brands using online questionnaires by Google Forms. Partial least square-structural equation modelling techniques were used to analyse the data and test the hypothesized relationships between the variables. Findings: The findings reveal significant positive relationships between brand experience and self-congruence, brand experience and brand trust, self-congruence and brand trust and self-congruence and brand image. Furthermore, brand trust and brand image emerged as a significant predictor of brand love within the halal fashion context. Research limitations/implications: The sample size and geographic scope were limited to consumers in Indonesia, which may impact the generalizability of the findings. Although fashion trends are often seen as more applicable to women, this research included both women and men to provide a comprehensive understanding of consumer behaviour. Future research should explore these constructs in diverse cultural contexts and consider gender-specific nuances to enhance generalizability and robustness. Practical implications: This study offers actionable strategies for halal fashion branding. Marketers should create brand experiences aligned with Islamic values, ensure transparency in sourcing and halal certification and embrace cultural diversity in campaigns. Leveraging digital platforms and influencers can enhance engagement and foster brand loyalty. These insights provide a framework for building trust, inclusivity and long-term success in the halal fashion market. Originality/value: This study offers a novel contribution by examining the relationships between brand experience, self-congruence, brand trust, brand image and brand love specifically within the halal fashion market. Unlike previous research, it focuses on how Islamic cultural and religious values influence these constructs, providing fresh insights into branding strategies in this niche sector. Theoretically, it enriches understanding of consumer behaviour in culturally specific markets, whereas practically, it offers actionable guidance for marketers to build trust and emotional connections with halal fashion consumers. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand experience; Brand trust; Halal fashion; Self-congruence","","","","","","","","Ahuvia A., Izberk-Bilgin E., Lee K., Towards a theory of brand love in services: the power of identity and social relationships, Journal of Service Management, 33, 3, pp. 453-464, (2022); Aji H.M., Muslichah I., Is halal universal?

In this study, the authors investigate the causal relationship between receiving a community gift and the recipient's subsequent social and monetary engagement behaviors by exploiting the randomization of recipient assignment on a popular live streaming platform, Twitch. They find that, relative to nonrecipients within a five-minute window of a community gifting event, community gift recipients exhibit a 69% chance of directing an additional message toward their peers, a 35% chance of directing an additional message toward the streamer, and a 5% chance of gifting an incremental subscription to the community. However, recipients are no more likely to tip the streamer. The authors apply computational linguistics methods to illustrate that recipients’ increased social engagement is accompanied by elevated sentiment and an increased likelihood of joining existing conversations. Finally, a series of moderator analyses show that recipients’ gifting behavior is less frequent when there are more gifting events prior to the focal community gift, enabling the recipient to hide. Moreover, the social engagement effect of receiving a community gift is greater when prior chatter is more voluminous and discontinuous, that is, when it is easier for the recipient to jump into the chat. We conclude that the spillovers to social engagement are more important than those to financial reciprocity given the positive feedback loop implied by our moderator analysis. Our results reveal how and when community gifting impacts audience engagement. © American Marketing Association 2024.","community engagement; difference-in-differences; live streaming; natural experiment; natural language processing; social technologies","","","","","","","","Baker W.E., Bulkley N., Paying It Forward vs. Rewarding Reputation: Mechanisms of Generalized Reciprocity, Organization Science, 25, 5, pp. 1493-1510, (2014); Batra R., Stayman D.M., The Role of Mood in Advertising Effectiveness, Journal of Consumer Research, 17, 2, pp. 203-214, (1990); Belk R.W., It’s the Thought That Counts: A Signed Digraph Analysis of Gift-Giving, Journal of Consumer Research, 3, 3, pp. 155-162, (1976); Belk R.W., (1977); Belk R.W., Coon G.S., Gift Giving as Agapic Love: An Alternative to the Exchange Paradigm Based on Dating Experiences, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 3, pp. 393-417, (1993); Benveniste A., (2023); Burtch G., He Q., Hong Y., Lee D., How Do Peer Awards Motivate Creative Content?

It is guided by two research questions: (1) How have sustainable fashion-related comments posted on YouTube fashion haul videos changed over time? and (2) What themes are relevant to sustainable fashion in the comments posted on fashion haul videos? Design/methodology/approach: A data set of comments from 110 fashion haul videos posted on YouTube was refined to only include comments with keywords related to sustainable fashion. Leximancer, a machine learning technique, was employed to identify concepts within the data and co-occurrences between concepts. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software was employed to assess the prevalence of concepts and identify sentiment over time. Findings: Over the decade, the authors identified increased comments and conversations relevant to sustainable fashion. For instance, conversations surrounding sustainable fashion were linked to “waste” and “addicted” between 2011 and 2013, which evolved to include “environment” and “clothes” between 2014 and 2016, to “buy” and “workers” between 2017 and 2019 and “sustainable” between 2020 and 2021, demonstrating the changes in conversation topics over time. Practical implications: With increasing engagement from YouTube viewers on sustainable fashion, retail-affiliated content that promotes sustainable fashion is proposed as one approach to engage viewers and promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry, whereby content creators can partner with retailers to feature products and educate viewers on the benefits of sustainable fashion. Originality/value: The findings suggest that consumers are becoming more aware of and responsive to sustainable fashion. The originality of this research stems from identifying the source of this interest. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","eWOM; Fashion haul; Fashion influencers; Fast fashion; Influencer marketing; Leximancer; LIWC; Sustainable fashion; YouTube","","","","","","","","Acuti D., Pizzetti M., Dolnicar S., When sustainability backfires: a review on the unintended negative side‐effects of product and service sustainability on consumer behavior, Psychology & Marketing, 39, 10, pp. 1933-1945, (2022); Alampi A., The future is micro: how to build an effective micro-influencer programme, Journal of Digital & Social Media Marketing, 7, 3, pp. 203-208, (2019); Almana A.M., Mirza A.A., The impact of electronic word of mouth on consumers' purchasing decisions, International Journal of Computer Applications, 82, 9, pp. 23-31, (2013); Barnes L., Lea-Greenwood G., Fast fashioning the supply chain: shaping the research agenda, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, 10, 3, pp. 259-271, (2006); Beard N.D., The branding of ethical fashion and the consumer: a luxury niche or mass-market reality?, Fashion Theory, 12, 4, pp. 447-467, (2008); Black S., The Sustainable Fashion Handbook, (2013); Bly S., Gwozdz W., Reisch L.A., Exit from the high street: an exploratory study of sustainable fashion consumption pioneers, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 39, 2, pp. 125-135, (2015); Brenot A., Chuffart C., Coste-Maniere I., Deroche M., Godat E., Lemoine L., Ramchandani M., Sette E., Tornaire C., Water footprint in fashion and luxury industry, Water in Textiles and Fa shion, pp. 95-113, (2019); Bruce M., Daly L., Buyer behaviour for fast fashion, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, 10, 3, pp. 329-344, (2006); Cha Y., Kim J., Park S., Yi M.Y., Lee U., Complex and ambiguous: understanding sticker misinterpretations in instant messaging, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 2, CSCW, pp. 1-22, (2018); Chetioui Y., Benlafqih H., Lebdaoui H., How fashion influencers contribute to consumers' purchase intention, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal, 24, 3, pp. 361-380, (2020); Cline E.L., Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion, (2012); Derashri I., Gogia S.K., Influence of fashion bloggers on consumer buying behavior: a literature review, The IIS University Journal of Commerce & Management, 8, 1, pp. 9-18, (2019); Ellis E.G., The psychological impact of seeing YouTubers spend millions, Wired, (2019); Evans S., Peirson-Smith A., The sustainability word challenge: exploring consumer interpretations of frequently used words to promote sustainable fashion brand behaviors and imagery, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal, 22, 2, pp. 252-269, (2018); Fletcher K., Slow fashion: an invitation for systems change, Fashion Practice, 2, 2, pp. 259-265, (2010); Fruend L., Sustainable fashion is the new social video movement, Tubular Insights, (2019); Gatersleben B., Murtagh N., Cherry M., Watkins M., Moral, wasteful, frugal, or thrifty?

Design/methodology/approach: Data for this study were collected from 300 users who follow the top 40 Pakistani social media macro-influencers using an online survey. The conceptual model and hypotheses were tested through process macro and structural equation modeling. Findings: This study finds informative, credible, novel, and aesthetically pleasing factors vital attributes of influencer-generated branded content, which indirectly (i.e. via BCE) and directly affects followers’ endorsed brand-related attitude. This study also finds that these factors have a positive attitudinal spillover effect on followers’ firm-generated endorsed brand-related ad-click behavior on social media. Practical implications: This study presents guidelines to firms and their partner influencers about designing and implementing follower-valued content-driven influencer marketing campaigns. Originality/value: This study contributes to extant influencer marketing literature by integrating multiple attributes of influencer-generated branded content, which carry different values for followers, and using the Self-perception theory, the Multi-attribute attitude model, and the Spillover theory to explain their indirect and direct effects on endorsed brand-related attitude and a subsequent attitudinal spillover effect on firm-generated endorsed brand-related ads. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ad-click behavior; Brand attitude; Brand content engagement; Branded content attributes; Social media influencers; Spillover effect","","","","","","","","Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modelling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Ashraf A., Hameed I., Saeed S.A., How do social media influencers inspire consumers' purchase decisions?

Video analytics is crucial for understanding marketing communications via TikTok, a video-based social media platform. This study aims to examine how luxury brands establish their presence and effectively attract and engage with young consumers on TikTok through social media video analytics. A multiple case study approach was employed on the selected four luxury fashion brands. Data were collected from the selected brands’ official accounts, endorsed users’ accounts, and related hashtag links on TikTok. A three-stage content analysis of social media video analytics was conducted. The common and customized strategies employed across the selected brands on TikTok were identified, respectively. The findings revealed that young consumers prefer high-quality videos regarding branding messages, branded challenges, and influencers-led branded content. A consumer-brand engagement framework was proposed based on the data analysis. This research contributes to understanding how TikTok benefits the fashion industry and offers theoretical and practical insights for fashion brands to better harness TikTok. This study represents a pioneering endeavor in exploring social media video analytics, contributing to the advancement of marketing analytics literature. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Consumer engagement; Luxury fashion brand; Marketing analytics; Social media video analytics; TikTok; Young consumer","","","","","","","","Abkenar S.B., Kashani M.H., Mahdipour E., Jameii S.M., Big data analytics meets social media: A systematic review of techniques, open issues, and future directions, Telematics and Informatics, 57, (2021); Ahuja V., Louis Vuitton: Using digital presence for brand repositioning and CRM, Handbook of Research on Effective Marketing in Contemporary Globalism, (2014); Arrigo E., Social media marketing in luxury brands: A systematic literature review and implications for management research, Management Research Review, 41, 6, pp. 657-679, (2018); Athwal N., Istanbulluoglu D., McCormack S.E., The allure of luxury brands’ social media activities: A uses and gratifications perspective, Information Technology & People, (2018); Barger V., Peltier J.W., Schultz D.E., Social media and consumer engagement: A review and research agenda, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 10, 4, pp. 268-287, (2016); Bastani F., Moll O., Madden S., Vaas: Video analytics at scale, Proceedings of the VLDB endowment, (2020); Bazi S., Filieri R., Gorton M., Customers’ motivation to engage with luxury brands on social media, Journal of Business Research, 112, pp. 223-235, (2020); Bazi S., Filieri R., Gorton M., Social media content aesthetic quality and customer engagement: The mediating role of entertainment and impacts on brand love and loyalty, Journal of Business Research, 160, (2023); Bendoni W.K., Social media for fashion marketing: Storytelling in a digital world, (2017); Bian Q., Forsythe S., Purchase intention for luxury brands: A cross cultural comparison, Journal of Business Research, 65, 10, pp. 1443-1451, (2012); Bilro R.G., Loureiro S.M.C., A consumer engagement systematic review: Synthesis and research agenda, Spanish Journal of Marketing-ESIC, 24, 3, pp. 283-307, (2020); Brodie R.J., Hollebeek L.D., Juric B., Ilic A., Customer engagement: Conceptual domain, fundamental propositions, and implications for research, Journal of Service Research, 14, 3, pp. 252-271, (2011); Brodie R.J., Ilic A., Juric B., Hollebeek L., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: An exploratory analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 105-114, (2013); Cheung M.L., Pires G.D., Rosenberger P.J., Leung W.K., Ting H., Investigating the role of social media marketing on value co-creation and engagement: An empirical study in China and Hong Kong, Australasian Marketing Journal, 29, 2, pp. 118-131, (2021); Corbin J.M., Strauss A., Grounded theory research: Procedures, canons, and evaluative criteria, Qualitative Sociology, 13, 1, pp. 3-21, (1990); da Cunha Brandao A.M.P., Barbedo H.E.M., Going (in)conspicuous: Antecedents and moderators of luxury consumption, Journal of Marketing Analytics, 11, 2, pp. 202-218, (2023); De Leyn T., De Wolf R., Vanden Abeele M., De Marez L., In-between child’s play and teenage pop culture: Tweens, TikTok & privacy, Journal of Youth Studies, 25, 8, pp. 1108-1125, (2022); Deng Q., Hine M.J., Ji S., Wang Y., Understanding consumer engagement with brand posts on social media: The effects of post linguistic styles, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 48, (2021); Fan W., Gordon M.D., The power of social media analytics, Communications of the ACM, 57, 6, pp. 74-81, (2014); Fetais A.H., Algharabat R.S., Aljafari A., Rana N.P., Do social media marketing activities improve brand loyalty?

Design/methodology/approach: Three studies (one qualitative and two quantitative) were conducted to understand the phenomenon better. The qualitative study (Study 1) was conducted to identify the antecedents of the theoretical model, which was tested in Study 2 using the covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) technique. Study 3 then divided the respondents based on the metaverse influencer attribute preferences. Findings: Results of Study 1 revealed the six most influential attributes of metaverse influencers: physical attractiveness, social attractiveness, perceived credibility, metaverse-influencer fit, intimacy and attitude homophily. Further, Study 2 validated that attractiveness and perceived credibility enhance engagement. Also, the results revealed that intimacy, perceived credibility and homophily enhance social glue. Moreover, parasocial relationships mediate the association between intimacy, attitude homophily, perceived credibility and (engagement and social glue). The conditional indirect effect of physical attractiveness, social attractiveness and metaverse–influencer fit on (engagement and social glue) via parasocial relationships at different high and low levels of self-discrepancy was significant. Finally, Study 3 used latent class analysis to reveal different clusters of metaverse users. Originality/value: This research enriches our understanding of metaverse influencers, contributing to the influencer marketing literature. It offers actionable insights for marketers by elucidating key influencer attributes, aiding in enhancing engagement and social glue. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Latent class analysis; Metaverse; Parasocial relationship; Self-discrepancy; Virtual influencer","","","","","","","","Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost human?

It examines the role of mental imagery in shaping these responses and investigates how perceived novelty moderates the relationship between playfulness and mental imagery. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted a scenario-based online survey using an actual video from a real Chinese influencer, with 701 tourists participating. In the second study, we used an experimental research design and created a video specifically for the experiment, where we manipulated the playfulness of the content, involving 402 participants. Findings: The results show that the playfulness of TikTok videos enhances mental imagery, which mediates the positive effect on customers’ attitudes and sharing intentions. Novelty further strengthens the impact of playfulness on mental imagery, highlighting the importance of both factors in destination marketing. Research limitations/implications: Data were collected in mainland China, where the travel short video content was shared by the blogger. Future research should validate these findings with travellers from different countries and destinations, expanding the understanding of consumer engagement on social media for destination marketing. Practical implications: This research has significant implications for creating destination marketing strategies on TikTok. Marketing managers and influencers should prioritise crafting playful video content while considering the unique appeal and novelty of the travel destination. This approach is crucial for fostering active customer engagement online. Originality/value: This research advances our understanding of how playfulness and novelty in TikTok videos influence mental imagery, impacting consumer attitudes and behaviour.

A quantitative methodology was utilized in this study, which involved the distribution of an online survey to a total of 732 young banking consumers in Vietnam. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated significant positive indirect effects on the intention to use influencer marketing in relation to influencer credibility, trustworthiness, expertise, friendliness, similarity, and attractiveness. The impacts mentioned were mediated by the individual's attitude toward the influencer. Favorable attitudes toward an influencer boosted respondents' intention to use endorsed banking products/services. Similarly, positive attitudes toward influencers directly increased usage intentions. The results offer innovative empirical proof that partnering with influencers on social media can serve as a successful marketing tactic for banks to positively impact the acceptance of their services among young consumers in Vietnam's digital landscape. The study provides practical recommendations for banks to effectively identify and collaborate with influencers who have the strongest appeal to youth target audiences. © The author(s) 2024.

However, even without brand involvement, vlogs can also “unintentionally” benefit influencers as a relationship-building tool. This study is designed to investigate the relationship between vlog-viewing and audiences’ purchase behaviors of influencer-recommended products through the impacts of influencer–follower interactions, perceived influencer credibility and parasocial relationships. Design/methodology/approach: An influencer-disseminated online survey was conducted in collaboration with a YouTube celebrity among N = 948 of her 72.6 K subscribers. Statistical analysis was performed through structural equation modeling (SEM) on SPSS Amos. Findings: SEM results indicated that the extent to which participants liked the vlogs had both a direct impact on their purchase behaviors and secondary impact through social media engagement, parasocial relationships and perceived influencer credibility. Originality/value: The study expands current research and understanding of influencer marketing. Brands and social media content creators are advised to rethink vlogs as a creative genre for long-term brand–influencer collaborations and implicit social media endorsements. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Influencer credibility; Influencer marketing; Parasocial relationship; Social media marketing; Vloggers; Vlogs","","","","","","Auburn University at Montgomery, AUM","The data collection of this study was supported by Research Funding from Auburn University at Montgomery.","AlRabiah S., Marder B., Marshall D., Angell R., Too much information: an examination of the effects of social self-disclosure embedded within influencer eWOM campaigns, Journal of Business Research, 152, pp. 93-105, (2022); Aw E.C.X., Chuah S.H.W., ‘Stop the unattainable ideal for an ordinary me!’ fostering parasocial relationships with social media influencers: the role of self-discrepancy, Journal of Business Research, 132, pp. 146-157, (2021); Bandura A., Walters R.H., Social Learning Theory, 1, (1977); Bi N.C., Zhang R., ‘I will buy what my ‘friend’ recommends’: the effects of parasocial relationships, influencer credibility and self-esteem on purchase intentions, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 17, 2, pp. 157-175, (2022); Blyth S.K., Connecting to others: studying the relationship between social exclusion and imitation, (2015); Broeder P., van Hout A., When friends recommend: online purchasing behavior of Russian and Dutch people when prompted by recommendations from Facebook friends, Russian Journal of Communication, 11, 3, pp. 191-203, (2019); Burgess J., All your chocolate rain are belong to us'?: Viral video, youtube and the dynamics of participatory culture, Video Vortex Reader: Responses to YouTube, pp. 101-109, (2008); Chen T.Y., Yeh T.L., Lee F.Y., The impact of Internet celebrity characteristics on followers' impulse purchase behavior: the mediation of attachment and parasocial interaction, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 15, 3, pp. 483-501, (2021); Chu S.C., Kamal S., The effect of perceived blogger credibility and argument quality on message elaboration and brand attitudes: an exploratory study, Journal of Interactive Advertising, 8, 2, pp. 26-37, (2008); De Jans S., Hudders L., Disclosure of vlog advertising targeted to children, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 52, 1, pp. 1-19, (2020); Deaton S., Social learning theory in the age of social media: implications for educational practitioners, Journal of Educational Technology, 12, 1, pp. 1-6, (2015); Dibble J.L., Hartmann T., Rosaen S.F., Parasocial interaction and parasocial relationship: conceptual clarification and a critical assessment of measures, Human Communication Research, 42, 1, pp. 21-44, (2016); Dinh T.C.T., Lee Y., ‘I want to be as trendy as influencers’–how ‘fear of missing out’ leads to buying intention for products endorsed by social media influencers, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 16, 3, pp. 346-364, (2022); Duhan D.F., Johnson S.D., Wilcox J.B., Harrell G.D., Influences on consumer use of word-of-mouth recommendation sources, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 25, 4, pp. 283-295, (1997); Falk E., Scholz C., Persuasion, influence, and value: perspectives from communication and social neuroscience, Annual Review of Psychology, 69, 1, pp. 329-356, (2018); Friestad M., Wright P., The persuasion knowledge model: how people cope with persuasion attempts, Journal of Consumer Research, 21, 1, pp. 1-31, (1994); Ho C.H., Chiu K.H., Chen H., Papazafeiropoulou A., Can internet blogs be used as an effective advertising tool?

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses data extracted from 2,081 videos posted on the prominent Chinese online live platform, Bilibili. The hypotheses are tested using regression models and natural language processing. Findings: The results indicate that the intensity of live comments at the beginning negatively affects users' digital engagement, while a corresponding increase in live comments at the end elicits a positive effect. A linear trend and peak difference in live comments intensity positively affect digital engagement, while the variability of live comment intensity exerts a negative effect. These MTM effects were driven by sentiments of live comments. Furthermore, in-video advertisements are likely to amplify the negative beginning effect on users' digital engagement and mitigate the negative variability of live comments. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine the direct effects of MTM comments from the online temporal sequence perspective, differentiating the process- and performance-based engagement. The mechanism and interactive role of in-video advertisements were identified.

Using netnography and an archival dataset on ten ethical influencers, we delineate their unique challenges and positioning. Ethical influencers legitimate their accounts via a close-up of personal practices, as opposed to an articulated persona, and connect with divergent audiences to advocate for the needed change. Our paper describes the divergent audience groups and engagement styles: allies, inquisitives, detractors, and enigmatics. We also identify the ethical influencers’ linking strategies to connect these audiences with other market actors (e.g. ethical businesses and other ethical influencers) which include acting, humanising, framing, pivoting, and evangelising.

This quantitative study engaged 550 Instagram users, focusing on contrasting shyness and confidence appeals. The participants were asked to fill out a survey via an online link in a controlled environment. Then, the structural equation modeling technique was used to test hypotheses, and multi-group analysis was employed to compare the effects of shyness and confidence. The results indicate a positive link between the antecedents and the consequences of telepresence. This study provides managerial insights into how users perceive virtual influencers with specific personality traits, emphasizing that personality-driven interface design can enhance virtual experiences by improving shyness and confidence. Furthermore, the findings suggest that tailoring virtual interactions to individual personalities can enhance engagement in gaming, virtual education, and workplaces. These insights can support industry managers in creating psychologically supportive and engaging virtual environments that foster positive human-technology interactions. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","interactivity; shyness and confidence; telepresence; user wellbeing; virtual influencers' personalities","","","","","","","","Ahmad W., Kim W.G., Choi H.M., Haq J.U., Modeling Behavioral Intention to Use Travel Reservation Apps: A Cross-Cultural Examination Between US and China, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 63, (2021); Ali A., Ul Haq J., Hussain S., Qadir A., Bukhari S.A.H., OCEAN Traits: Who Shares More Word of Mouth?, Journal of Promotion Management, 28, 6, pp. 749-773, (2022); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost Human?

Recently, social media networks (SNSs) allow SMIs to earn money through virtual tip-jars (VTPs). VTPs allow SNS users to send money to SMIs. YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitch offer VTPs (Perelli, 2021). Despite the popularity of VTPs in the industry, marketing research has not yet examined VTPs. Building on the theory of norms of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960), our research addresses this gap by examining the factors that influence SMI-tipping. We examine several factors that would influence consumers’ intentions to virtually tip SMIs. We propose that certain factors related to the SMI (SMI’s attractiveness. Authenticity and expertise), the content the SMI generates (interactivity, informational value, and hedonic value) and the relationship between the SMI and his/her followers increase the follower’s intention to reciprocate the SMI’s efforts through engaging with the SMI’s content and sending monetary tips to that SMI. We recruited 303 participants (Mean Age = 37.5, 37% male) from MTurk to participate in an online survey. Participants were asked to respond to the questions based on their perceptions of a specific influencer they follow on Instagram. Participants were first asked to name this influencer and then answer several questions regarding that SMI. We used previously established and reliable scales for measuring our independent variables and reciprocity intentions. We measured the likelihood of monetary payback by asking participants how likely they were to (a) make a one-time payment and (b) monthly payments to an influencer. We found that two variables increase consumers’ intentions to reciprocate the SMI’s efforts by sending virtual tips: (a) self-SMI connection and (b) interactivity of the contents created by the SMI. We found that individuals who had a higher self-SMI connection and higher perceived content interactivity were more likely to make a one-time donation, more likely to set up monthly payments to the SMI, and also were more likely to reciprocate by liking, commenting, and sharing the SMI’s created content. Our study contributes to the academic literature on social media and influencer marketing by exploring the novel phenomenon of virtual tipping, investigating the important role of reciprocity in consumer engagement with SMIs, and providing guidelines for SMIs who aim to increase their equity through getting tips from their followers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Reciprocity; Social media; Social media influencer; Virtual tipping","","","","","","","","","F.

This is essential because the research creates a theoretical model of follower loyalty/stickiness to virtual influencer techniques from the standpoint of influencer marketing, which has a substantial effect on the evolution of the global marketing world. Design/methodology/approach: In 2022, 302 people who currently follow an Instafamous virtual influencer took part in an Instagram self-administered online survey. Findings: The findings show that both expertise and trustworthiness have a positive and significant influence on parasocial interaction, which in turn has a significant influence on virtual engagement and stickiness. Originality/value: This research will specifically assist international readers in understanding how to harness and increase the efficiency and efficacy of interactive marketing strategies and methods to engage and retain followers of Instafamous virtual influencer. Moreover, the findings will be beneficial to opinion leaders, brand managers, company investors, entrepreneurs and service designers. Highlights: The study pioneers a holistic virtual follower stickiness mechanism that comprises the role of source credibility, parasocial interaction, informational influence and virtual follower’s engagement and their interrelationship to each other. This study is based on parasocial interaction theory and source credibility theory to understand the relationship between virtual followers and influencers stickiness process at social media platforms. In addition, the study examined the subsequent effects of sources of credibility components on parasocial interaction; as well as, on virtual follower engagement and stickiness. This study also categorized and examined the moderating effects exerted by the genres of informative influence of virtual influencer. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Informational influence; Instagram; Parasocial interaction; Source credibility; Virtual follower engagement; Virtual follower stickiness","","","","","","","","Abidin C., Internet Celebrity: Understanding Fame Online, (2018); Agnihotri D., Chaturvedi P., Kulshreshtha K., Tripathi V., Investigating the impact of authenticity of social media influencers on followers' purchase behavior: mediating analysis of parasocial interaction on Instagram, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 35, 10, pp. 2377-2394, (2023); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The future of social media in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 79-95, (2020); Arora A., Bansal S., Kandpal C., Aswani R., Dwivedi Y., Measuring social media influencer index-insights from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 49, pp. 86-101, (2019); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost human?

Through a large-scale, mixed-methods analysis of an influencer's “promotional crisis” in early 2023, popularly known as “Mascaragate” on TikTok, we identified follower engagement types that potentially harm both SMI and the promoted brand. The crisis sparked an unusually high level of network activity, providing valuable insights into the ripple effects of follower reactions. Drawing on parasocial relationship theory and social capital theory, we proposed that interactions between influencers and their followers, as well as among followers, evolve systematically through linguistic and social cues. These interactions can shift the original meaning of the influencer's message, leading to unintended consequences for both SMI and the brand. Through netnography and k-means cluster analysis, we identified three distinct clusters of followers with unique attitudes toward the post and SMI. One group (i.e., “Type 1”) was particularly adept at reshaping the meaning of the SMI post through rational engagement with other followers. A subsequent experiment assessed the impact of each group's comments on the observers within a broader community network, focusing on credibility, skepticism, and the impact of social media dependency. The findings offer practical tools for brands and SMIs to analyze follower comment patterns and suggest strategies for addressing crises stemming from SMI-linked promotional content, ultimately helping to preserve brand reputation and trust. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Influencer Marketing; Influencer Promotion Crisis; Influencer Transgressions; Parasocial Relations; Social Capital; Social Media Influencer-Audience Relationship; Social Media Influencer-Follower Network; TikTok","","","","","","","","Adler P.S., Kwon S.W., Social capital: prospects for a new concept, The Academy of Management Review, 27, 1, pp. 17-40, (2002); Alhabash S., Mundel J., Hussain S.A., Social media Advertising: Unraveling the mystery box, pp. 285-299, (2017); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Guidry Moulard J., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Bacile T.J., Observers’ complaint language perceptions: A new measure to aid social media service recovery evaluations, Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 32, 2, pp. 210-232, (2024); Bacile T.J., Elmadag A.B., Okan M., Dineva D., Rynarzewska A.I., Schadenfreude and sympathy: observer reactions to malicious joy during social media service recovery, Journal of Interactive Marketing, (2024); Baek Y.M., Ihm J., Word use as an unobtrusive predictor of early departure from organizations, Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 40, 2, pp. 238-259, (2020); Barki H., Hartwick J., CONCEPTUALIZING THE CONSTRUCT OF INTERPERSONAL CONFLICT, International Journal of Conflict Management, 15, 3, pp. 216-244, (2004); Belanche D., Casalo L.V., Flavian M., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Understanding influencer marketing: the role of congruence between influencers, products and consumers, Journal of Business Research, 132, pp. 186-195, (2021); Bonus J.A., Matthews N.L., Wulf T., The impact of moral expectancy violations on audiences’ parasocial relationships with movie heroes and villains, Communication Research, 48, 4, pp. 550-572, (2021); Boyd R., Ashokkumar A., Seraj S., Pennebaker J., The Development and Psychometric Properties of LIWC-22, (2022); Brady S.T., Cohen G.L., Jarvis S.N., Walton G.M., A brief social-belonging intervention in college improves adult outcomes for black Americans, Science Advances, 6, 18, pp. 1-12, (2020); Braun V., Clarke V., Can I use TA?

This study pays close attention to not only the effects source trustworthiness and parasocial relationships exert on eWOM influence but also the antecedents driving them. This study additionally considers the moderating role of brand credibility in the relationships between the two key constructs and eWOM influence. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the reliability and validity of the constructs. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey was sent to university students in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to collect 766 responses, which were then analyzed using an SEM approach. The sampling strategy was based on convenience and snowball sampling techniques to ensure a diverse representation of the student population. Respondents were asked to rate their perceptions of source trustworthiness, parasocial relationships, brand credibility, and eWOM influence regarding social media influencers they follow. The collected data were then analyzed using an SEM approach, utilizing software such as AMOS to validate the measurement model and test the proposed structural relationships. Findings: The results confirm the strong impact of source trustworthiness and parasocial relationships on eWOM influence and recognize source authenticity to be the most powerful driver behind the two. Additionally, the findings suggest that brand credibility can positively moderate how source trustworthiness affects eWOM influence, with interaction effects examined through multi-group analysis. Originality/value: Relevant implications for researchers and marketing practitioners are discussed, emphasizing the strategic selection of eWOM sources and the cultivation of brand credibility to enhance consumer engagement. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand credibility; eWOM influence; Parasocial relationship; Source authenticity; Source trustworthiness","","","","","","","","Abd-Elaziz M.E., Aziz W.M., Khalifa G.S., Abdel-Aleem M., Determinants of Electronic word of mouth (EWOM) influence on hotel customers' purchasing decision, Journal of Faculty of Tourism and Hotels, Fayoum University, 9, 2-2, pp. 194-223, (2015); Abubakar A.M., Ilkan M., Impact of online WOM on destination trust and intention to travel: a medical tourism perspective, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 5, 3, pp. 192-201, (2016); Alam S.S., Bakar Z., Ismail H.B., Ahsan N., Young consumers online shopping: an empirical study, Journal of Internet Commerce, 11, 4, pp. 391-408, (2012); Amos C., Holmes G., Strutton D., Exploring the relationship between celebrity endorser effects and advertising effectiveness: a quantitative synthesis of effect size, International Journal of Advertising, 27, 2, pp. 209-234, (2008); Asada A., Ko Y.J., Determinants of word-of-mouth influence in sport viewership, Journal of Sport Management, 30, 2, pp. 192-206, (2016); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Guidry Moulard J., Authenticity under threat: when social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, July, pp. 557-569, (2018); Auter P.J., Palmgreen P., Development and validation of a parasocial interaction measure: the audience-persona interaction scale, Communication Research Reports, 17, 1, pp. 79-89, (2000); Aw T.C., Labrecque L.I., Celebrity endorsement in social media contexts: understanding the role of parasocial interactions and the need to belong, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 37, 7, pp. 895-908, (2020); Ballantine P.W., Martin B.A.S., Forming parasocial relationships in online communities, Advances in Consumer Research, 32, pp. 197-201, (2005); Bao T.T., Chang T.L.S., The product and timing effects of eWOM in viral marketing, International Journal of Business, 21, 2, pp. 99-111, (2016); Bergkvist L., Zhou K.Q., Celebrity endorsements: a literature review and research agenda, International Journal of Advertising, 35, 4, pp. 642-663, (2016); Braunsberger K., Munch J.M., Source expertise versus experience effects in hospital advertising, Journal of Services Marketing, 12, 1, pp. 23-38, (1998); Breves P.L., Liebers N., Abt M., Kunze A., The perceived fit between instagram influencers and the endorsed brand: how influencer–brand fit affects source credibility and persuasive effectiveness, Journal of Advertising Research, 59, 4, pp. 440-454, (2019); Breves P., Liebers N., Abt M., Kunze A., Schramm H., Blind trust?

Using the lens of the social influence theory, this study investigated engagement, loyalty, and purchase likelihood as constructs that impact brand influencer advertising. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze data in this study. The findings showed that brand influencer impact was associated with previous engagement and purchase likelihood of TikTok users. Previous perceptions toward brand influencers did not moderate the impact of brand influencer advertising.

Building on this premise, this study aims to examine the impact of different influencer types, categorized by follower count, on the advertised brands. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the hypotheses in four studies, including one secondary data analysis and three experiments. Findings: Combining real-world data with a series of experiments, the authors show that the followers of mega-influencers (vs micro influencers) have a more positive response to the advertised brands, with more positive brand attitudes, greater purchase intentions and higher engagement. The authors call this the “mega-influencer follower effect.” It is driven by the sense of control. This effect only occurs among the followers and not nonfollowers. Moreover, the mega-influencer follower effect only existed in human influencers, not virtual influencers. Research limitations/implications: This study takes influencer followers as influencer advertising audiences and investigates the effect of influencer types (based on the number of followers) on the advertised brands; however, future research may investigate how consumers respond to brands in different categories endorsed by influencers. Practical implications: The authors argue that influencer advertising audiences are more likely to be followers of the influencer. From this perspective, the results suggest that marketers should cooperate with mega-influencers. Originality/value: Through emphasizing the value of followers rather than nonfollowers as audiences, this study expands the literature on influencer marketing and the explanatory mechanisms regarding which types of influencers are more effective. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Influencer marketing; Sense of control; Social media; Social media influencer","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72272061); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China, (22YJC630077); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (23JNQMX12); 2024 Guangdong Provincial Ordinary University, (2024WTSCX007)","This project is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (72272061); The Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science project (22YJC630077); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (23JNQMX12), and 2024 Guangdong Provincial Ordinary University Research Project (2024WTSCX007).

This research analyses the impact of influencer activism on perceived authenticity and prosocial behaviors, focusing on collaborations with brands and nonprofit organizations. Drawing on social influence theory and signaling theory, two key factors are examined: the influencer-partner congruity, and the influencer-sociopolitical issue alignment. The research consists of a preliminary study, four experimental studies on behavioral intentions, two experimental studies on proxies of actual behavior, and a content analysis on Instagram comments. The results suggest that congruity and alignment significantly enhance perceived authenticity, which positively impacts attitudes toward the influencer and increases the intention to engage in prosocial behaviors. The article offers further insight into individual engagement in actual prosocial behavior, such as seeking information on an issue, subscribing to newsletters, and signing petitions. The research underscores the importance of selecting congruent influencers, whose values and advocacy efforts are consistent with the brand's or organization's characteristics, and aligned with relevant issues, to enhance perceived authenticity, foster genuine engagement and effectively drive prosocial behaviors through effective partnerships. © 2024 The Author(s).

They also offer influencers, acting as representatives of brands, an opportunity to develop relationships with consumers and through this, shape purchase intentions. Despite this, research is yet to examine how specific media characteristics, namely media richness and media naturalness act to shape the illusory parasocial relationship that forms between the influencer and the influenced as well as how media characteristics impact upon perceptions of authenticity. Media richness relates to the ability of information to change understanding within a specific time interval and media naturalness refers to the degree to which communication incorporates proximity, feedback, facial expression, body language and speech. This study addresses this research gap by examining the salience of the relationships between media richness, media naturalness, perceived authenticity and parasocial interactions. It then examines the relationships between these constructs and purchase intentions. Structural equation modelling and a sample of 221 social media users was employed to examine the interrelationships between constructs. The findings reveal that parasocial interactions were the strongest driver of purchase intent. Media richness had an important role to play in the development of authentic and genuine parasocial interactions. These interactions subsequently play a large role in shaping purchasing behaviours. Media naturalness and authenticity were however revealed to be necessary but not sufficient conditions for purchase. Understanding the role of media richness and naturalness in social media marketing will support marketing managers to design effective campaigns that enhance conversion. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","authenticity; engagement; influencers; Media; purchase intentions","","","","","","","","Anandarajan M., Zaman M., Dai Q., Arinze B., Generation Y adoption of instant messaging: An examination of the impact of social usefulness and media richness on use richness, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 53, 2, pp. 132-143, (2010); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and two-step recommended approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 453-460, (1998); Arbuckle J.L., Wothke W., Amos 4.0 user’s guide, (1999); Asheim B., Coenen L., Vang J., Face-To-Face, buzz, and knowledge bases: Sociospatial implications for learning, innovation, and innovation policy, Environment and Planning C, Government & Policy, 25, 5, pp. 655-670, (2007); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: An exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology & Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Audrezet A., De Kerviler G., Moulard J.G., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2018); Aw E.-C.-X., Labrecque L.I., Celebrity endorsement in social media contexts: Understanding the role of parasocial interactions and the need to belong, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 37, 7, pp. 895-908, (2020); Beer C., Social Browsers Engage with Brands, GlobalWebIndex, (2018); Beverland M., Kates S.M., Lindgreen A., Chung E., Exploring consumer conflict management in service encounters, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 617-633, (2010); Breidbach C.F., Brodie R., Hollebeek L., Gummesson E., Mele C., Polese F., Beyond virtuality: From engagement platforms to engagement ecosystems, Managing Service Quality, 24, 6, pp. 592-611, (2014); Brown W.J., Examining four processes of audience involvement with media personae: Transportation, parasocial interaction, identification, and worship, Communication Theory, 25, 3, pp. 259-283, (2015); Byron K., Carrying too heavy a load? the communication and miscommunication of emotion by email, Academy of Management Review, 33, 2, pp. 309-327, (2008); Cameron N., Report: Australian digital advertising spend rebounds in Q3, 2020 [Online], CMO, (2020); Carlson J.R., Zmud R.W., Channel expansion theory and the experiential nature of media richness perceptions, Academy of Management Journal, 42, 2, pp. 153-170, (1999); Chen C.-P., Exploring personal branding on YouTube, Journal of Internet Commerce, 12, 4, pp. 332-347, (2013); Chung S., Cho H., Fostering parasocial relationships with celebrities on social media: Implications for celebrity endorsement, Psychology & Marketing, 34, 4, pp. 481-495, (2017); Cornelis E., Peter P.C., The real campaign: The role of authenticity in the effectiveness of advertising disclaimers in digitally enhanced images, Journal of Business Research, 100, 77, pp. 102-112, (2017); Daft R.L., Lengel R.H., Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design, Management Science, 32, 5, pp. 554-571, (1986); De Veirman M., Cauberghe V., Hudders L., Marketing through Instagram influencers: The impact of number of followers and product divergence on brand attitude, International Journal of Advertising, 36, 5, pp. 798-828, (2017); Degruttola M., Survey reveals how consumers really judge brand authenticity (and influencers), Social Media Today, (2019); Dennis A.R., Fuller R.M., Valacich J.S., Media, tasks, and communication processes: A theory of media synchronicity, MIS Quarterly, 32, 3, pp. 575-600, (2008); Dennis A.R., Kinney S.T., Testing media richness theory in the new media: The effects of cues, feedback, and task equivocality, Information Systems Research, 9, 3, pp. 256-274, (1998); Dennis A.R., Valacich J.S., Rethinking media richness: Towards a theory of media synchronicity, Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences.

In marketing, videos are an increasingly successful means for brand to engage with consumers, with several studies finding that video content leads to more consumer engagement (i.e., liking, commenting, or sharing) than text content, which affects brand attitudes and purchase intentions (e.g., Li & Xie, 2020). Social media influencers generate a significant amount of video content online, while many brands spend at least 10% of their yearly marketing budget on influencer marketing (Geyser, 2021). However, there is a gap in research investigating the key characteristics in influencer posts that lead to engagement, particularly when it comes to video rather than textual content. In short, there is a need for more understanding about how best to design video content that engages customers. With this in mind, we explore how video characteristics in influencer marketing campaigns affect consumer engagement (in the form of liking and commenting). Specifically, we ask: (1) how emotional facial expressions in video content, and (2) corresponding post descriptions (i.e., textual cues) affect consumer engagement with influencers’ social media posts. To answer our research questions, we collected 2,376 social media posts from Instagram that were published from 1,240 influencers in partnership with 145 brands across ten product categories, such as apparel, beauty, and technology. All videos were analysed using Schwenzow et al.’s (2020) video tool that enables researchers to analyse a broad range of video characteristics on a large scale. The post descriptions were analysed with Language Inquiry Word Count (LIWC-22). LIWC is a text-analytics software (Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010) that uses dictionaries to calculate the degree to which each piece of text contains specific category words, such as first-person pronouns or emotional words (e.g., happy, cried, nice, ugly). Our results show that, compared to neutral facial expressions, emotional facial expressions in the video are negatively associated with engagement. On the contrary, we find that emotionality in the post description is positively associated with engagement. Finally, our findings suggest a significant moderation effect of product category (hedonic vs. utilitarian) on the relationship between emotionality in the post description and engagement. Theoretically, drawing on an interplay of theories including emotional contagion theory and heuristic-systematic model of information processing, we shed light on the nature of the relationship between social media post characteristics and consumer engagement in an influencer context. Practically, we provide advice on how a popular form of marketing content, video, can be used in an increasingly popular marketing context; influencer marketing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Consumer engagement; Emotionality; Facial expressions; Hedonic value; Influencer marketing; LIWC; Social media; Utilitarian value; Video content","","","","","","","","","J.

However, identifying the drivers of influencer marketing effectiveness and conditions that enhance their impact remains challenging. This meta-analysis, which synthesizes 1,531 effect sizes from 251 papers, assesses influencer marketing effectiveness by examining its antecedents, mediators, and moderators. Building on the persuasion knowledge model to develop and test a framework, we identify post, follower, and influencer characteristics as key antecedents impacting both non-transactional (i.e., attitude, behavioral engagement, and purchase intention) and transactional (i.e., purchase behavior and sales) marketing outcomes. For non-transactional outcomes, follower characteristics (social identity) have the strongest effects on consumer attitudes and behavioral engagement, while post characteristics (informational value and hedonic value) exert stronger effects on purchase intention. For transactional outcomes, influencer characteristics (influencer communication) have the strongest effects on purchase behavior. These antecedents also affect marketing outcomes indirectly through persuasion knowledge and source credibility. Moderation results indicate that direct and indirect effects of antecedents depend on social media types (i.e., nature of connection and usage) and product types (i.e., information availability and status-signaling capability). These results consolidate and advance the literature and offer insights into enhancing the effectiveness of influencer marketing. © The Author(s) 2024.","Influencer marketing; Persuasion knowledge model;

The primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of SEO strategies in influencing consumer behavior. A quantitative methodology was adopted, employing a non-experimental, cross-sectional, and correlational design. 100 real estate SEO experts in Peru, who were recruited from LinkedIn, were surveyed. Data were collected through surveys, and the analysis was conducted using the SPSS statistical software. The findings revealed that brand awareness, keyword analysis, and marketing strategy are pivotal components in the development of successful SEO approaches. Simultaneously, factors such as brand awareness, marketing performance, and brand interaction emerged as critical influencers of digital consumer behavior. The statistical analysis yielded a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.707, indicating a strong positive relationship between organic positioning strategies and digital consumer behavior. These results underscore the practical value of implementing effective SEO strategies in enhancing consumer engagement and behavior in the digital space. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that well-executed organic positioning strategies can significantly improve digital consumer behavior, offering valuable insights for real estate companies seeking to optimize their digital marketing efforts. This highlights the importance of incorporating targeted SEO techniques to strengthen brand presence and drive consumer engagement in an increasingly competitive market. © Socrates Deza-De-Souza-Ferreyra, Maria Jeanett Ramos-Cavero, Franklin Cordova-Buiza, 2025.","content marketing; keyword analysis; Peru; SEO; social media; web analytics","","","","","","","","Aguayo-Villodas B.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative approach to test the proposed model based on the stimulus–organism–response (SOR) theory. The non-probability purposive sampling technique was used to collect data from Pakistani mobile users through a self-administered questionnaire. Findings: The study results prove that VC alone cannot generate mobile users’ engagement. SA is the key in this regard, which has a relatively higher importance compared to SIC. Furthermore, the serial mediation effect of SA and SIC on CE shows that attractive sources are likely to induce higher SIC and subsequent CE. Practical implications: The results reveal that without a pleasing SA and positive SIC, mobile users skip the ads by perceiving them to be irritating or interruptive. Mobile ads might cost relatively less, but the advertisers should understand the significance of the SA toward minimizing the mobile advertising skepticism. Originality/value: Advertisers can enhance the user’s engagement on mobile devices by addressing both the SA and SIC in their VC. The combined effect of both the SA and SIC on CE has not been assessed before. Furthermore, this study has used the SOR mechanism to examine CE. © 2023, Muhammad Talha, Zonaib Tahir and Iqra Mehroush.","Customer engagement; Mobile advertising; Self-influencer congruence; SOR; Source appearance;

The information acceptance model was applied, which addresses the characteristics of acceptance: attitude, need, quality, credibility, intention, and use of information. This model was validated through structural equation modelling based on a survey of 381 people who use social networking websites. The results indicated that all the variables of the applied model and their characteristics are directly related to the way influencers connect to their audience and the finding that the ‘emotional relationship’ that influencers create with their followers is key for information acceptance.

This study employed a survey method to gather responses from individuals who had viewed food and beverage content on TikTok, created by restaurant operators, influencers, and former customers who had patronized the establishments. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that the perceived credibility of TikTok content creators including restaurant operators, influencers, and former customers significantly affected the restaurant’s credibility on TikTok and consumers’ enjoyment. This, in turn, greatly influenced their intentions to engage with the restaurant’s TikTok content and their likelihood of making a purchase at the restaurant. This study advances theoretical and practical knowledge by assessing the reliability of TikTok content creators which provided understanding of the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) Model by investigating how content from restaurants, influencers, and former customers affects restaurant credibility on TikTok and delivers a hedonic experience to consumers. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Content creators;

Social media influencers, through effective personal branding and content creation, form strong connections with their followers, significantly impacting their audience’s perceptions, attitudes, and purchasing decisions. This study explores the effects of social media influencers’ source credibility, comprising trustworthiness, expertise, and attractiveness, on consumers’ purchase intentions and behaviors regarding beauty products in Vietnam. A quantitative approach was utilized, with data collected from 269 Vietnamese consumers through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results showed that all three components of source credibility, including trustworthiness, expertise, and attractiveness, significantly and positively influenced consumers’ purchase intentions for beauty products. Among these factors, expertise had the strongest effect on purchase intention (β = 0.289, p < 0.001), followed by trustworthiness (β = 0.216, p = 0.001), and attractiveness had the weakest influence on purchase intention (β = 0.195, p < 0.001). Moreover, purchase intention was found to have a significant positive impact on purchase behavior (β = 0.545, p = 0.004). These findings provide valuable insights for marketing managers and companies seeking to optimize their influencer partnerships by selecting influencers whose credibility aligns with their brand values and leveraging their expertise to build consumer trust, drive engagement, and influence purchase decisions. © Gia Khuong An, Thi Thuy An Ngo, Thanh Tu Tran, Phuong Thy Nguyen, 2024.","attractiveness; beauty products; expertise; social media influencer; source credibility; trustworthiness","","","","","","","","Al Mamun A., Nawi N.

More than half of the world's population, companies, influencers, and celebrities use social media platforms to promote a desired image and advertise ideas and products. Social media users and influencers document many different aspects of their lives to the public. In that regard, one type of product prominently portrayed on social media is food. The present research investigates how the type of food (healthy vs. unhealthy) featured next to a person in a social media ad or influencer post impacts online engagement. The results of four studies, including a field experiment on Facebook, reveal that an image of a healthy (vs. an unhealthy) food adjacent to a person leads to higher engagement and higher likelihood to try a recommended product. This effect is driven by greater identification with the person in the image when the adjacent food is healthy (vs. unhealthy). © American Marketing Association 2022.","digital marketing; food pictures; healthy food; influencers; social media; unhealthy food","","","","","","","","Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The Future of Social Media in Marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 79-95, (2020); Argo J.J., Dahl D.W., Morales A.C., Consumer Contamination: How Consumers React to Products Touched by Others, Journal of Marketing, 70, 2, pp. 81-94, (2006); Argo J.J., Dahl D.W., Morales A.C., Positive Consumer Contagion: Responses to Attractive Others in a Retail Context, Journal of Marketing Research, 45, 6, pp. 690-701, (2008); Auter P.J., Palmgreen P., Development and Validation of a Parasocial Interaction Measure: The Audience-Persona Interaction Scale, Communication Research Reports, 17, 1, pp. 79-89, (2000); Belanche D., Casalo L.V., Flavian M., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Understanding Influencer Marketing: The Role of Congruence Between Influencers, Products, and Consumers, Journal of Business Research, 132, pp. 186-195, (2021); Berger J., Word of Mouth and Interpersonal Communication: A Review and Directions for Future Research, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 586-607, (2014); Briggs S.R., Cheek J.M., The Role of Factor Analysis in the Development and Evaluation of Personality Scales, Journal of Personality, 54, pp. 106-148, (1986); Burger J.M., Messian N., Patel S., del Prado A., Anderson C., What a Coincidence!

With brands increasingly partnering with influencers, research is yet to provide an integrated perspective examining the critical role of both parties. This study aims to draw on the source credibility model and signaling theory to explain the mechanisms that matter in influencer marketing effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model of influencer marketing effectiveness is analyzed using partial least squares with data from 281 followers of social media influencers. Findings: The authors establish influencer characteristics of popularity and attractiveness as heuristic cues that inform judgments of influencer efficacy. Further, category involvement and altruistic motives for collaboration are shown to moderate followers’ reliance on these heuristic cues. Then, a sequential mediating effect demonstrates the critical roles of the influencer and partner brand in three desired outcomes: enhanced perception of brand authenticity, enhanced brand engagement and positive attitudes toward influencer posts. Research limitations/implications: Future research should consider other heuristic cues that could inform influencer efficacy judgments and switch the focus toward the partner brand’s impact on such judgments. Practical implications: A step-by-step visual framework is presented to help marketers and influencers translate these findings into key responsibilities for developing more effective and collaborative partnerships. Originality/value: Besides presenting an integrated perspective, signaling theory provides an original lens for explaining influencer marketing effectiveness, addressing the need to expand the theoretical boundaries of influencer marketing research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand engagement; Influencer characteristics; Influencer marketing; Signaling theory","","","","","","","","Amos C., Holmes G., Strutton D., Exploring the relationship between celebrity endorser effects and advertising effectiveness: a quantitative synthesis of effect size, International Journal of Advertising, 27, 2, pp. 209-234, (2008); Aria M., Cuccurullo C., Bibliometrix: an R-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis, Journal of Informetrics, 11, 4, pp. 959-975, (2017); Balabanis G., Chatzopoulou E., Under the influence of a blogger: the role of information‐seeking goals and issue involvement, Psychology and Marketing, 36, 4, pp. 342-353, (2019); Bergh D.D., Connelly B.L., Ketchen D.J., Shannon L.M., Signalling theory and equilibrium in strategic management research: an assessment and a research agenda, Journal of Management Studies, 51, 8, pp. 1334-1360, (2014); Bergkvist L., Zhou K.Q., Celebrity endorsements: a literature review and research agenda, International Journal of Advertising, 35, 4, pp. 642-663, (2016); Boerman S.C., Willemsen L.M., Van Der Aa E.P., This post is sponsored’: effects of sponsorship disclosure on persuasion knowledge and electronic word of mouth in the context of Facebook, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 38, pp. 82-92, (2017); Bower A.B., Landreth S., Is beauty best?

This paper equips readers with actionable knowledge and skills to excel in this paradigm shift. The paper explores how cultural understanding can drive the success of brand positioning and campaigns in an ever-changing world. This exploration uncovers the convergence of innovation, creativity and data in crafting a new era of marketing where imagination knows no bounds. Key takeaways include: (1) Understanding cultural relevance: Culture is a driving force influencing consumer behaviour and perceptions. Brands must grasp cultural nuances to connect with diverse audiences authentically. This involves adapting products, messaging and values to resonate with specific cultural contexts. (2) Harnessing Big Data: Employing advanced analytics tools and techniques allows marketers to target effectively, create data-driven strategies, and gain insights into consumer behaviour. The combination of surveys, social media listening and data mining reveals valuable patterns and trends. (3) Omni-channel journeys: To remain relevant, brands must deliver a seamless customer experience across various channels — online and offline. Omni-channel marketing ensures consistent messaging and personalised interactions, enhancing customer engagement and loyalty. (4) The impact of influencer marketing: The rise of influencers has democratised influence, reshaping how brands connect with consumers. Leveraging influencer partnerships and user-generated content helps build cultural relevance and authenticity, resonating with consumers. (5) Redefining partnerships: Collaborations with like-minded partners across sports, music, influencers, and more, amplify brand relevance. Partnerships should align with brand values, resonate with consumers, and deliver against business objectives. The paper underscores the need for culture-centric approaches, emphasising genuine connections, active participation and meaningful brand purpose. By embracing cultural understanding, harnessing data-driven strategies, adopting omni-channel tactics, leveraging influencers and redefining partnerships, marketers can navigate the evolving landscape and thrive in the future of marketing. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS 2050-0076 (2023).","consumer centricity; cultural marketing; data-driven; omni-channel marketing","","","","","","","","Edelman Trust Barometer 2019 Global Report, (2019); Malnight T.W., Buche I., Dhanaraj C., Put purpose at the core of your strategy, Harvard Business Review, (2020); Special report: Brand trust & the coronavirus pandemic, (2020); 2021 Global Impact Report, (2021); Kantar is a global data, insights and consulting company that specialises in market research, advertising effectiveness, consumer behaviour and other related services.

Complementing DCM pursuits with social media influencers’ (SMIs) brand content can further enhance the ameliorating results. This study aimed to empirically assess DCM’s relationship with consumer brand engagement on social media and how SMI’s brand content moderates this relationship. Through a quantitative approach, the empirical data was purposively collected from 1022 respondents via a web-based survey questionnaire. The findings indicate that DCM campaigns with an information, entertainment, commercial, and emotional focus have positive relationships with consumer brand engagement, except when DCM campaigns have negative emotional elements. Moreover, the brand content of SMIs significantly moderates the relationship between DCM elements and brand engagement. However, DCM campaigns with negative emotional elements have a negative relationship on brand engagement when SMI is a moderator. This study is significant as it empirically tests the interplay among DCM, SMIs, and brand engagement on social media, contributing to the literature on this topic. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand engagement; DCM; Digital content marketing; influencer marketing; SMIs; social media influencers","","","","","","","","Abhishek A., Srivastava M., Mapping the Influence of Influencer Marketing: A Bibliometric Analysis, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 39, 7, pp. 979-1003, (2021); AlRabiah S., Marder B., Marshall D., Angell R., Too Much Information: An Examination of the Effects of Social Self-Disclosure Embedded within Influencer eWOM campaigns, Journal of Business Research, 152, pp. 93-105, (2022); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The Future of Social Media in Marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 79-95, (2020); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative Strategies in Social Media Marketing: An Exploratory Study of Branded Social Content and Consumer Engagement, Psychology & Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Beard F., Petrotta B., Dischner L., A History of Content Marketing, Journal of Historical Research in Marketing, 13, 2, pp. 139-158, (2021); Boerman S.C., Willemsen L.M., Van Der Aa E.P., “This Post is sponsored”: Effects of Sponsorship Disclosure on Persuasion Knowledge and Electronic Word of Mouth in the Context of Facebook, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 38, pp. 82-92, (2017); Borchers N.S., Enke N., Managing Strategic Influencer Communication: A Systematic Overview on Emerging Planning, Organization, and Controlling Routines, Public Relations Review, 47, 3, (2021); Bu Y., Parkinson J., Thaichon P., Digital Content Marketing as a Catalyst for E-WOM in Food Tourism, Australasian Marketing Journal, 29, 2, pp. 142-154, (2021); Campbell C., Farrell J.R., More Than Meets the Eye: The Functional Components Underlying Influencer Marketing, Business Horizons, 63, 4, pp. 469-479, (2020); Christodoulides G., Michaelidou N., Siamagka N.T., Social Media, Content Marketing and Engagement Strategies in B2B, Industrial Marketing Management, 81, pp. 87-88, (2019); Chung N., Han H., The Relationship Among tourists’ Persuasion, Attachment and Behavioral Changes in Social Media, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 123, pp. 370-380, (2017); Cocker H.L., Cronin J., Charismatic Authority and the YouTuber: Unpacking the New Cults of Personality, Marketing Theory, 17, 4, pp. 455-472, (2017); Annual B2B Content Marketing Benchmarks, Budgets, and Trends: Insights for 2021 Report, (2020); Delbaere M., Michael B., Phillips B.J., Social Media Influencers: A Route to Brand Engagement for Their Followers, Psychology & Marketing, 38, 1, pp. 101-112, (2021); Devereux E., Grimmer L., Grimmer M., Consumer Engagement on Social Media: Evidence from Small Retailers, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 19, 2, pp. 151-159, (2020); Dolega L., Rowe F., Branagan E., Going Digital?

Authenticity has attracted the attention of an increasing number of researchers (e.g., Beverland, 2005; Beverland & Farrelly, 2010; Grayson & Martinec, 2004; Moulard et al., 2016). At a broad level, authenticity is defined as what is true, genuine, real (Beverland & Farrelly, 2010) and low authenticity and fakeness are used interchangeably (e.g., Pine & Gilmore, 2008). Most scholars who study authenticity conceptualize it as an integral property of an object and quite often operationalize it as an agent’s perception that the object is real, genuine, or true. This research goes beyond previous studies and challenges this narrow definition of authenticity as a property of an object. Instead, we redefine authenticity as a combination of both agent and object properties. In fact, we argue that it is only in the absence of internal motivations for authentic judgments in the agent that agents look outside of themselves for external clues in the object. Using our new definition, we show that fakeness, quite often condemned as the opposite of authenticity, can lead to authentic judgments by consumers and positive outcomes for brands and the firm. An experimental design is adopted to test hypotheses on the impact of the authenticity of social media influencers (SMIs) on brand credibility, brand engagement and purchase intention. These results will be relevant to managers and researchers as technology transforms virtual interactions with consumers and firm investments in social media marketing communications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Authenticity; Brand credibility; Brand engagement; Fakeness; Purchase intentions; Virtual influencers","","","","","","","","","C.

Methodology: The information was gathered via a survey, and 360 answers were included in the final analysis. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the relationships among the constructs. Findings: We found that the perceived social media influencers’ (SMIs) credibility and message content dimensions (atheistic and usefulness) increased the followers’ contributed engagement and the intention to visit the endorsed restaurant through parasocial relationships and customer attitude. Furthermore, the media richness of SMI’s posts enhanced the relationship between influencer credibility, aesthetic message content, and followers’ contributed engagement. Practical Implications: When choosing a specific SMI for their promotion strategy, restaurant owners should take into account media richness criteria in addition to influencer credibility, aesthetics, and usefulness posts. Originality: This study combined the S–O–R theory with media richness theory, in contrast to previous influencer literature research, to explain the influencers’ effect on their followers. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Social media influencers on YouTube are popular for brand promotion. However, more research is needed to understand the effectiveness of social media influencer marketing and message appeal campaigns. This study uses 800 YouTube videos observed directly to determine social media influencer marketing’s performance via customer engagement. According to the study, informational and emotional message appeals affect Instagram customer engagement differently, while sponsorship and expertise moderate the effect. In customer involvement, informational message appeals work better than emotional ones. Sponsorship disclosures improve client engagement in informational videos. In addition, informational message appeals attract customers better than emotional appeals when knowledge is high. The study shows that message appeals, sponsorship, and expertise can engage customers. © 2024, Econjournals.

Influencers and businesses can work together to market a company's goods or services to their subscriber base. Influencers can significantly affect sales and performance by endorsing goods or services and including their affiliate links in their content. Influencers and businesses can collaborate to produce sponsored content, in which the influencers create interesting and genuine posts or videos showcasing the brand's goods or services. By doing so, businesses can connect with the influencer's audience and use their power and inventive storytelling abilities. Businesses can benefit from this tactic by expanding their reach, increasing engagement, and boosting traffic to their websites and physical stores. For influencers to continue earning the trust of their audience, they must always be genuine and transparent in their collaborations. Influencers can influence business performance, so this study aims to review the bibliometrics literature using the Scopus database. © 2024, IGI Global.

However, among these social media influencers are computer-generated virtual humans with millions of followers. Known as “virtual influencers,” these virtual humans exist purely in the digital world where consumers can follow their content and interact with them online. That said, little research has looked beyond the traditional social media influencer, and thus, within a two-study design, the present study explores what motivates consumers to follow virtual influencers (Study 1), what heuristics are accessed when thinking about virtual influencers (Study 1), and what effect does heuristic cueing have on attitudes toward virtual influencers and brand attachment (Study 2). Study 1 brings in the psychological theory of Self-Determination to define virtual influencers’ follower and engagement motivations, while the Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability (MAIN) model is used to explore the technological phenomenon of heuristics cues with virtual influencer engagement. The findings indicate that consumers follow virtual influencers mainly because of their novelty and to fulfill curiosity. At the same time, they choose not to follow virtual influencers because of a lack of relatedness, perceived inauthenticity and creepiness, and lack of knowledge about certain virtual influencers. Study 2 utilizes a mixed reality approach to examine whether consumers experience the transfer of attachment towards brands and products endorsed by the virtual influencer. In addition to promoting products available in the real-world, several virtual influencers endorse virtual goods that exist merely in the digital world. Findings suggest that while the mixed reality approach - a virtual influencer with a real product - shows a more positive attitude towards the virtual influencer, the attachment towards the brand of the real product is less than the virtual product. Findings also provide evidence for the “uncanny valley” effect as there are greater positive attitudes toward the virtual influencer and greater attachment towards the brand when the virtual influencer is alone versus with a real human. As media and technology continue to advance and integrate into influencer marketing, the findings of Studies 1 and 2 are essential building blocks for the human-computer interaction and consumer behavior literature. While Study 1 expands on the theoretical concepts of self-determination and the MAIN model, Study 2 provides practical implications with virtual influencers as brand endorsers in virtual and mixed reality settings. Additionally, clarity regarding the followers’ motivations, or lack of, and the heuristics of the virtual influencers that boost engagement helps designers in the growth and sustenance of the concept of these virtual humans, as well as make the brands and advertisers feel confident about the utility of virtual influencers as an integral part of their campaign. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advertising; Information processing; Media effects; Mixed reality; Motivation; Social media; Virtual influencers","","","","","","","","","J.

Moreover, we test the moderating role of consumers' emotional attachment to the influencer and the mediating role of brand engagement in affecting purchase intention. Finally, we delve into the antecedents of influencer effectiveness and their relationship with consumers' actual purchases. To do so, we leverage two quantitative studies (n1 = 248; n3 = 247) and a qualitative one. Results from Study 1 indicate that the lower consumers perceive the gap between the brand personality and self-image, the more they are inclined to engage with and purchase a brand. Moreover, we find that the emotional attachment to the influencer does not play a role in influencing purchase intention, positing that emotional attachment and BPC have different emotion dynamics with different purchase outcomes. Building on Study 1, Study 2 leverages a focus group to identify the antecedents of influencer effectiveness. Results highlight that a sense of indulgence appears in the minds of consumers when confronted with brands that have a lower congruity with their self. This sense of indulgence, in the case of low BPC, hinders the ability of the influencer to create an engagement between the brand and the consumer. Finally, Study 3 quantitatively tests the antecedents of influencer effectiveness under two conditions (entertaining vs. informative content type) highlighting the different influence of the antecedents on individuals with high (vs. low) BPC. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","brand engagement; brand personality self-congruity; emotional attachment; influencer marketing","","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., Measuring brand equity across products and markets, California Management Review, 38, 3, pp. 102-120, (1996); Aaker J.L., Dimensions of brand personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 347-356, (1997); Aaker J.L., The malleable self: The role of self-expression in persuasion, Journal of Marketing Research, 36, 1, pp. 45-57, (1999); Abidin C., Communicative intimacies: Influencers and percieved interconnectedness, (2015); Abidin C., Visibility labour: Engaging with influencers' fashion brands and# OOTD advertorial campaigns on Instagram, Media International Australia, 161, 1, pp. 86-100, (2016); Aguirre-Rodriguez A., Bosnjak M., Sirgy M.J., Moderators of the self-congruity effect on consumer decision-making: A meta-analysis, Journal of Business Research, 65, 8, pp. 1179-1188, (2012); Albert N., Ambroise L., Valette-Florence P., Consumer, brand, celebrity: Which congruency produces effective celebrity endorsements?, Journal of Business Research, 81, pp. 96-106, (2017); Alboqami H., Trust me, I'm an influencer! - Causal recipes for customer trust in artificial intelligence influencers in the retail industry, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 72, (2023); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Armitage C.J., Conner M., Efficacy of the theory of planned behaviour: A meta-analytic review, British Journal of Social Psychology, 40, 4, pp. 471-499, (2001); Bagozzi R.P., Gopinath M., Nyer P.U., The role of emotions in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 2, pp. 184-206, (1999); Bargoni A., Giachino C., Battisti E., Iaia L., The effects of influencer endorsement services on crowdfunding campaigns, Journal of Services Marketing, 37, 1, pp. 40-52, (2023); Barta S., Belanche D., Fernandez A., Flavian M., Influencer marketing on TikTok: The effectiveness of humor and followers' hedonic experience, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 70, (2023); Bentler P.M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models, Psychological Bulletin, 107, 2, pp. 238-246, (1990); Bowden J.L.H., The process of customer engagement: A conceptual framework, Journal of marketing theory and practice, 17, 1, pp. 63-74, (2009); Breves P.L., Liebers N., Abt M., Kunze A., The perceived fit between instagram influencers and the endorsed brand: How influencer–brand fit affects source credibility and persuasive effectiveness, Journal of Advertising Research, 59, 4, pp. 440-454, (2019); Cha M., Haddadi H., Benevenuto F., Gummadi K.P., (2010); Cheng Y., Chen Y.R.R., Hung-Baesecke C.J.F., Social media influencers in CSR endorsement: the effect of consumer mimicry on CSR behaviors and consumer relationships, Social Science Computer Review, 39, 4, pp. 744-761, (2021); Ki C.W., Park S., Kim Y.K., Investigating the mechanism through which consumers are “inspired by” social media influencers and “inspired to” adopt influencers' exemplars as social defaults, Journal of Business Research, 144, pp. 264-277, (2022); Choi L., Burnham T., Brand reputation and customer voluntary sharing behavior: the intervening roles of self-expressive brand perceptions and status seeking, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 30, 4, pp. 565-578, (2020); Choi S.M., Rifon N.J., It is a match: The impact of congruence between celebrity image and consumer ideal self on endorsement effectiveness, Psychology & marketing, 29, 9, pp. 639-650, (2012); Colliander J., Dahlen M., Following the fashionable friend: The power of social media: Weighing publicity effectiveness of blogs versus online magazines, Journal of Advertising Research, 51, 1, pp. 313-320, (2011); Daneshvary R., Schwer R.K., The association endorsement and consumers' intention to purchase, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 17, 3, pp. 203-213, (2000); Dean D.H., Biswas A., Third-party organization endorsement of products: An advertising cue affecting consumer prepurchase evaluation of goods and services, Journal of advertising, 30, 4, pp. 41-57, (2001); Dehghani M., Tumer M., A research on effectiveness of Facebook advertising on enhancing purchase intention of consumers, Computers in Human Behavior, 49, pp. 597-600, (2015); Djafarova E., Rushworth C., Exploring the credibility of online celebrities' Instagram profiles in influencing the purchase decisions of young female users, Computers in Human Behavior, 68, pp. 1-7, (2017); Dou X., Walden J.A., Lee S., Lee J.Y., Does source matter?

Analyzing 91 videos via multiple regression analysis, the research uncovers practical insights for content creators and marketers, as well as theoretical findings for academics. Notably, Alisha Lehmann's active professional life, showcasing her athletic prowess, emerged as the most influential category, driving engagement across views, likes, comments, saves, and shares. Videos emphasising her personal life through aesthetics also impacted video shares and saves to a certain degree. Additionally, non-active or non-sport professional life content garnered attention, especially in likes and comments. In contrast, TikTok games and promotional content had limited impact, emphasizing the importance of a balanced content strategy that integrates personal and professional aspects for athlete influencers. These findings provide guidance for optimizing online presence, aligning content with audience interests, and fostering brand loyalty on TikTok. © 2024, IGI Global.

This paper examines how SMBE mediates the effects of firm-generated content (FGC) and user-generated content (UGC) on brand trust, considering the moderating effects of social media influencer endorsement (SMIE) and self-image congruence (SIC) for luxury residential properties (LRPs). Design/methodology/approach: Around 516 high-income homebuyers in Vietnam who shared information about LRP on social media were targeted to test the research model empirically. The primary data collected from paper-based surveys were analysed using SPSS 26 and AMOS 24. Findings: Results indicate that FGC and UGC positively impact SMBE and consequently significantly affect brand trust. Further, results confirm the moderating roles of SMIE and SIC in the effects of FGC and UGC on SMBE. Research limitations/implications: Data and sample size were limited to meet the generalisation from different nations and cross cultures. Practical implications: The authors' findings suggest that marketers should apply the authors' integrated SMBE model to strengthen brand–consumer interactions and increase their sales revenue. Originality/value: This study is the first in its application of the uses and gratifications theory and self-congruence theory to investigate how SMBE mediates the relationship between FGC and brand trust as well as between UGC and brand trust. Noticeably, this study makes a novel contribution as the first to quantitatively explore the moderating effects of SMIE and SIC in the authors' research model. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand trust;

Gamification is a term used to characterize a strategy that uses game aspects in non-gaming environments to enhance conversion rates. Although gamification is a relatively new concept, it has its roots in marketing campaigns such as point cards and rewards programs. In marketing, gamification is basically the use of game-based techniques and aspects to attract consumers, engage them, and finally influence their purchase decision. The chapter is based on content analysis of research articles from scientific databases, using qualitative data analysis software. For a comprehensive understanding of the analyzed data, the chapter contains a concept map and word clouds.

Given the importance of the influencer phenomenon, many studies have been published about this topic in the previous years. However, there are still several areas that need further research. One of these areas is the conceptualization of influencers. The influencer phenomenon is dynamic, so what was understood as an influencer ten years ago may have evolved and changed. Additionally, classifications based on the number of followers may be easily manipulated, so there is need for an improved classification of influencers based on their potential reach. Following this criterion, the authors propose to classify influencers as mega-reach, macro-reach, medium-reach, and mini-reach influencers. Moreover, the numerous factors that may determine their influence are still not well accounted for nor organized. Finally, most studies have analyzed the success of influencers as a new marketing tool, but the way influencers collaborate with brands is very special and has also evolved recently. This chapter contributes to previous literature by proposing a renewed definition and classification of influencers that is more consistent with their origin, evolution, and progressive level of professionalization, as well as by identifying several research gaps that may guide future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Disclosure; Engagement; Follower; Influencer; Interactivity; Potential reach","","","","","","","","Alba J.W., Hutchinson J.W., Dimensions of consumer expertise, Journal of Consumer Research, 13, 4, pp. 411-454, (1987); Al-Emadi F.A., Yahia I.B., Ordinary celebrities related criteria to harvest fame and influence on social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing., 14, 2, pp. 195-213, (2020); Araujo T., Neijens P., Vliegenthart R., Getting the word out on Twitter: The role of influentials, information brokers and strong ties in building word-of-mouth for brands, International Journal of Advertising, 36, 3, pp. 496-513, (2017); Balaban D.C., Szambolics J., A proposed model of self-perceived authen-ticity of social media influencers, Media and Communication, 10, 1, pp. 235-246, (2022); Berthon P., Pitt L., Watson R.T., Re-surfing W3: Research perspec-tives on marketing communication and buyer behavior on the worldwide web, International Journal of Advertising, 15, 9, pp. 287-301, (1996); Bi N.C., Zhang R., I will buy what my ‘friend’ recommends: The effects of parasocial relationships, influencer credibility and self-esteem on purchase inten-tions, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, Ahead-of-Print, (2022); Boerman S.C., The effects of the standardized Instagram disclosure for micro-and meso-influencers, Computers in Human Behavior, 103, pp. 199-207, (2020); Boerman S.C., Muller C.M., Understanding which cues people use to identify influencer marketing on Instagram: An eye tracking study and experiment, International Journal of Advertising, pp. 1-24, (2021); Boerman S.C., Van Reijmersdal E.A., Disclosing influencer marketing on YouTube to children: The moderating role of para-social relationship, Frontiers in Psychology, 10, (2020); Boerman S.C., Willemsen L.M., van der Aa E.P., “This post is spon-sored”: Effects of sponsorship disclosure on persuasion knowledge and electronic word of mouth in the context of Facebook, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 38, pp. 82-92, (2017); Bu Y., Parkinson J., Thaichon P., Influencer marketing: Homophily, customer value co-creation behaviour and purchase intention, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 66, (2022); Burns K., The history of social media influencers in research perspectives on social media influencers and brand communication, pp. 1-21, (2021); Campbell C., Farrell J.R., More than meets the eye: The functional components underlying influencer marketing, Business Horizons, 63, 4, pp. 469-479, (2020); Casalo L.V., Flavian C., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Influencers on instagram: Antecedents and consequences of opinion leadership, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 510-519, (2020); Chae J., Explaining females’ envy toward social media influencers, Media Psychology, 21, 2, pp. 246-262, (2017); Chen T.Y., Yeh T.L., Lee F.Y., The impact of Internet celebrity charac-teristics on followers’ impulse purchase behavior: The mediation of attachment and parasocial interaction, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 15, 3, pp. 483-501, (2021); Correa S.C.H., Soares J.L., Christino J.M.M., Gosling M.D.S., Goncalves C.A., The influence of YouTubers on followers’ use intention, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 2, pp. 173-194, (2020); Cresci S., Di Pietro R., Petrocchi M., Spognardi A., Tesconi M., Fame for sale: Efficient detection of fake Twitter followers, Decision Support Systems, 80, pp. 56-71, (2015); De Veirman M., Cauberghe V., Hudders L., Marketing through Instagram influencers: The impact of number of followers and product divergence on brand attitude, International Journal of Advertising, 36, 5, pp. 798-828, (2017); De Veirman M., Hudders L., Nelson M.R., What is influencer marketing and how does it target children?

The current study examines the role of influencer flattery in driving the prosocial behavior of social media users. Specifically, the research investigates how flattery and humanlike appearance influence the perceived authenticity of VIs and the subsequent prosocial behavior of social media users (Studies 1 and 2). Furthermore, the research substantiates these effects by exploring how flattery and anthropomorphism via humanlike traits impact perceived authenticity and prosocial behavior when social media users witness the influencer praising others (Study 3). Beyond intention to donate (Study 1), the study also investigated its impact on related prosocial behaviors, such as click-through behavior (Study 2) and the willingness to pay for fundraising merchandise (Study 3). The findings of this research offer concrete implications for nonprofit organizations by demonstrating the persuasive impact of flattery, perceived authenticity, and anthropomorphism in mobilizing public support, donations, and merchandise purchases for social causes. © 2024 The Authors.

Grounded in Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model, this study explores the factors influencing users’ intention to adhere to HVIs recommendations. Data were collected from a cohort of 290 participants through an online crowdsourcing platform. SmartPLS were used to run SEM, mediation and moderation analysis. Results indicate that the intention to follow HVIs recommendations is positively affected by interest fit, perceived credibility, and virtual flow experience. Mimetic desire mediates the relationship between homophily, virtual flow experience, and intention to follow recommendations. Moreover, charisma significantly moderates the relationship between interest fit, perceived anthropomorphism, and mimetic desire. Furthermore, parasocial relationships significantly moderate the association between perceived anthropomorphism and mimetic desire. The study provides practical insights that are valuable for hospitality brands to leverage HVIs in their marketing strategies, ultimately enhancing overall user engagement. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","anthropomorphism; charisma; Hospitality virtual influencer; mimetic desire; SOR model; virtual flow experience","","","","","","","","Ahmad N., Abdulkarim H., The impact of flow experience and personality type on the intention to use virtual world, International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction, 35, 12, pp. 1074-1085, (2019); Ahn R.J., Cho S.Y., Sunny Tsai W., Demystifying computer-generated imagery (CGI) influencers: The effect of perceived anthropomorphism and social presence on brand outcomes, Journal of Interactive Advertising, 22, 3, pp. 327-335, (2022); Akhtar N., Hameed Z., Islam T., Pant M.K., Sharma A., Rather R.A., Kuzior A., Avatars of influence: Understanding how virtual influencers trigger consumer engagement on online booking platforms, Journal of Retailing & Consumer Services, 78, (2024); Akter S., Fosso Wamba S., Dewan S., Why PLS-SEM is suitable for complex modelling?

The purpose of this study is to examine a unique stereotype related to men’s social media use. Design/methodology/approach: Four experiments examine judgments of men based on how often they post on social media (frequently vs infrequently). Findings: The authors find that posting frequently (vs infrequently) affects the perceived gender of men but not women. This frequent-posting femininity stereotype is explained by perceived neediness and holds regardless of whether posts are about others (vs the self) or whether posts are shared by influencers (vs ordinary users). Research limitations/implications: Future research should examine other stereotypes of social media users – including those pertaining to gender – and ways to mitigate such negative attributions. Researchers should examine how the frequent-posting femininity stereotype and other social media use stereotypes affect social media consumption and consumer well-being. Practical implications: Managers should adjust consumer engagement strategies and restructure platforms to address the unique stigmas facing different consumer groups. Originality/value: Providing insights into the dark side of social media, the authors investigate a unique domain – stereotypes about individual social media users. The findings of this study uncover an emasculating stigma against men who post often on social media, which may discourage men from online participation. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dark side; Digital consumption; Gender; Masculinity; Post frequency; Social media; Stereotype","","","","","","","","Akestam N., Rosengren S., Dahlen M., Liljedal K.T., Berg H., Gender stereotypes in advertising have negative cross-gender effects, European Journal of Marketing, 55, 13, pp. 63-93, (2021); Baccarella C.V., Wagner T.F., Kietzmann J.H., McCarthy I.P., Social media?

Although SMIs are becoming more professional and are differentiating themselves in terms of content and communication styles, quantitative indicators such as reach and engagement rates are still at the centre of marketers’ attention. This study identifies and tests five qualitative types of social media influencers (‘storyteller’, ‘rationalist’, ‘expert’, world-changer’ and ‘extravert’) based on four key motivational factors for content creation from a broad international sample. The authors find differences regarding the relative frequencies of the identified SMI types between the surveyed countries.

The study on electrical and electronic appliances covered by YouTubers is an entirely new field of research. Knowing why customers watch their product review videos before purchasing would be interesting. Design/methodology/approach: We analyzed 172 product review videos from influencers on YouTube. Subsequently, the study employed negative binomial regression (NB2) to predict the explanatory power of the independent variables over the dependent variables. Findings: This paper recommends two different models for viewer engagement in online review videos. One can be used for high and the other for low viewer engagement. Comparatively, viewers put more effort into commenting on a video than liking it. Yet both have their importance as per the requirement. Research limitations/implications: We only focused on video content in English and Hindi. The study data considered review videos from various electrical and electronic appliances. Future researchers may replicate this study on different product categories. Practical implications: This study makes a remarkable contribution to how firms and their managers can optimize video content when designing marketing strategies, particularly for retailers and e-tailers. Originality/value: The current paper takes the lead in contributing to the existing literature on marketing in two ways. First, focusing on product review videos from influencers and second, employing a video analysis approach. Furthermore, this study recommends two different viewer engagement models for marketing practices when employing quantitative and qualitative video content. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Comments; Customer engagement; Likes; Product review videos; Video analysis; YouTube","","","","","","","","Abhishek, Srivastava M., Mapping the influence of influencer marketing: a bibliometric analysis, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 39, 7, pp. 979-1003, (2021); Agrawal S.R., Disclosure of silent branding during COVID-19 pandemic: a study of Sarsiwa village in Chhattisgarh state of India, International Journal of Rural Management, 18, 3, pp. 394-409, (2022); Agrawal S.R., Mittal D., Optimizing customer engagement content strategy in retail and e-tail: available on online product review videos, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 67, (2022); Aljukhadar M., Senecal S., Communicating online information via streaming video: the role of user goal, Online Information Review, 41, 3, pp. 378-397, (2017); Anderson K.C., Knight D.K., Pookulangara S., Josiam B., Influence of hedonic and utilitarian motivations on retailer loyalty and purchase intention: a Facebook perspective, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 21, 5, pp. 773-779, (2014); Appiah O., Rich media, poor media: the impact of audio/video vs text/picture testimonial ads on browsers' evaluations of commercial web sites and online products, Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising, 28, 1, pp. 73-86, (2006); Basch C.H., Brown A.A., Fullwood M.D., Clark A., Fung I.H., Yin J., YouTube as a source of information on skin bleaching: a content analysis, Clinical and Experimental Dermatology, 43, 4, pp. 399-403, (2018); Bi N.C., Zhang R., Ha L., Does valence of product review matter?

However, whether influencers with lower or higher follower count are more effective in generating engagement remains an open question. This multimethod research effort—involving an observational field data analysis, based on 802 Instagram marketing campaigns featuring more than 1,700 influencers, together with an eye-tracking study and laboratory experiments—establishes conclusive evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between influencers’ follower count and engagement with sponsored content. A higher follower count implies broader reach but also cues a weaker relationship that reduces followers’ engagement likelihood. That is, engagement first increases, then decreases, as influencer follower count rises. The authors further test the potential moderating effects of two campaign properties: content customization and brand familiarity. Higher content customization and lower familiarity of the sponsored brand signal that influencers value their relationships with followers and thereby flatten the inverted U-shaped relationship. Managers can leverage these novel results and the related actionable guidelines to improve their influencer marketing strategies. © The Author(s) 2022.","brand familiarity; content customization; influencer indegree; influencer marketing; inverted U-shape; multimethod study; social media engagement","","","","","","","","(2021); Algoe S.B., Haidt J., Gable S.L., Beyond Reciprocity: Gratitude and Relationships in Everyday Life, Emotion, 8, 3, pp. 425-429, (2008); Aral S., Dhillon P.S., Social Influence Maximization Under Empirical Influence Models, Nature Human Behaviour, 2, 6, pp. 375-382, (2018); Aral S., Walker D., Tie Strength, Embeddedness, and Social Influence: A Large-Scale Networked Experiment, Management Science, 60, 6, pp. 1352-1370, (2014); Barratt L., (2021); Basuroy S., Desai K.K., Talukdar D., An Empirical Investigation of Signaling in the Motion Picture Industry, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 2, pp. 287-295, (2006); Bleier A., Eisenbeiss M., Personalized Online Advertising Effectiveness: The Interplay of What, When, and Where, Marketing Science, 34, 5, pp. 669-688, (2015); (2019); Campbell M.C., Keller K.L., Brand Familiarity and Advertising Repetition Effects, Journal of Consumer Research, 30, 2, pp. 292-304, (2003); (2020); Chae I., Bruno H.A., Feinberg F.M., Wearout or Weariness?

Based on value co-creation theory and consumer inference, this paper proposes that consumers infer influencers have more expertise with and more favorable attitude toward the product from value co-creation. Consequently, such behavior can foster consumer engagement and favorable attitude toward the recommended product. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected real-world data and conducted four sets of experimental studies. In the experimental studies, the presence of an influencer’s value co-creation behavior (i.e. co-creation vs. control) was manipulated to test the causal effect and mechanisms of co-creation on engagement and product attitude. Findings: Results show that influencers’ value co-creation behavior positively affects consumers’ engagement and attitudes toward the product. These effects are driven by perceived influencer’s expertise with and favorability toward the product (Studies 1 and 2). Co-creating utilitarian value is more effective than co-creating hedonic value (Studies 3A and 3B). In addition, influencers with a larger number of followers benefit more from co-creation behavior than those with fewer followers (Study 4). Research limitations/implications: This research adds to the literature on value co-creation by investigating how, why and when influencers’ value co-creation enhances consumer responses to the post. Our investigation concretizes value co-creation behavior in the context of influencer marketing and demonstrates its signaling effect with nuanced role of value type in shaping the effect. The findings provide a novel cue that influencers can use to enhance consumer responses to their posts. Practical implications: Brands should encourage influencers to focus on value-in-use co-creation when promoting their products. While emphasizing value co-creation in influencer partnership, brands should also carefully consider the type and size of influencers they collaborate with based on the nature of their products and target audience. The research findings also provide practical implications for influencers, offering guidance on how they can optimize their content creation strategies and enhance their effectiveness in influencer marketing collaborations. Originality/value: This research enriches understanding of value co-creation in the context of influencer marketing and the role of content specifics in influencers’ posts. The findings provide a novel cue that influencers can use to enhance consumer responses to their posts. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer engagement; Influencer marketing; Influencer type; Value co-creation","","","","","","Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2024A1515011903); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72372058, 72372166,72002082, 71972108); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Key Research Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Shenzhen, (SZ2023A011)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72372058, 72372166,72002082, 71972108), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2024A1515011903), and the Key Research Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Shenzhen (SZ2023A011).

Within this context, a specific aspect of content entrepreneurship stands out—social media influencers. These influencers attract brands due to their attentional capital and persuasive power. Currently, the development of such influence is not instantaneous but a progressive journey, with influencers exhibiting varying degrees of influence at different stages. For brands aiming to foster effective collaborations, understanding these stages is crucial. However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive theoretical structure that encompasses the full spectrum of the influencer's journey. As such, drawing from the entrepreneurship literature, this paper proposes a model that delineates how social media users develop and enhance their brand as influencer-entrepreneurs and how their roles transform across the various stages of entrepreneurial progression and facilitate strategic marketing engagement. The proposed model comprises five stages: influence potential, influence formulation, influence competence, influence monetization, and influence reward. In light of the collaborative dynamics between influencers and brands, the model further provides strategic guidance for brand managers and marketers on engaging with influencers at various stages of their journey. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study examines the effectiveness of product attribute description in the context of sponsored videos. Using a field dataset of 598 sponsored videos, we demonstrate that influencers’ use of product attribute description as an endorsement strategy has a negative impact on video engagement, and this effect is stronger for trial versus awareness campaigns. However, the negative impact is reversed to a positive one when product attribute description is employed for utilitarian products but not for hedonic products. These results reveal that the effectiveness of product attribute description depends on the nature of the product and the campaign objectives. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of influencer marketing effectiveness and sheds light on the nuances of endorsement strategies. Practical implications on how to optimise endorsement effectiveness and video performance are discussed. © 2024 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","influencer marketing; product attribute description; Social media influencer (SMI) endorsement; trial campaign; utilitarian product","","","","","","","","Akpinar E., Berger J., Valuable virality, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 2, pp. 318-330, (2017); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Guidry Moulard J., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Becker M., Scholdra T.P., Berkmann M., Reinartz W.J., The effect of content on zapping in TV advertising, Journal of Marketing, 87, 2, pp. 275-297, (2023); Annual & Interim reports, (2022); SEC Filings, (2022); Boerman S.C., Muller C.M., Understanding which cues people use to identify influencer marketing on Instagram: An eye tracking study and experiment, International Journal of Advertising, 41, 1, pp. 6-29, (2022); Campbell C., Farrell J.R., More than meets the eye: The functional components underlying influencer marketing, Business Horizons, 63, 4, pp. 469-479, (2020); Campbell M.C., Kirmani A., Consumers’ use of persuasion knowledge: The effects of accessibility and cognitive capacity on perceptions of an influence agent, Journal of Consumer Research, 27, 1, pp. 69-83, (2000); Casalo L.V., Flavian C., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Influencers on Instagram: Antecedents and consequences of opinion leadership, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 510-519, (2020); Chang C.-T., Chen P.-C., Cause-related marketing ads in the eye tracker: It depends on how you present, who sees the ad, and what you promote, International Journal of Advertising, 36, 2, pp. 336-355, (2017); Chang C.-T., Chu X.Y.M., Tsai I.-T., How cause marketing campaign factors affect attitudes and purchase intention: Choosing the right mix of product and cause types with time duration, Journal of Advertising Research, 61, 1, pp. 58-77, (2021); Chang C.-T., Yen C.-T., Missing ingredients in metaphor advertising: The right formula of metaphor type, product type, and need for cognition, Journal of Advertising, 42, 1, pp. 80-94, (2013); Chen L., Yan Y., Smith A.N., What drives digital engagement with sponsored videos?

Design/methodology/approach: This study utilized a quantitative research design, analyzing 1,660 influencer-created videos over a six-month period. Narrative elements were examined through manual coding, and their impact on live comments was assessed using negative binomial regression to identify key factors driving audience engagement. Findings: Research results show that non-fictional characters, imaginable titles and concrete details significantly increased live comments. Conversely, high replication difficulty negatively influenced engagement. Notably, influencer-character congruence and artistic processing showed no significant effect. Originality/value: This study advances the extended transportation-imagery model by integrating narrative elements with live comments, offering new perspectives on real-time audience engagement. The findings deepen our understanding of how storytelling techniques enhance the effectiveness of influencer marketing.

According to advanced algorithms for machine learning, predictive analytics not only forecasts consumer actions but also enables marketers to tailor their marketing efforts with never-before-seen precision. But the opportunities have grown greater still because of the growth of generative AI, an innovative technology that has the capability to completely alter customer engagement, modification, and content production. This chapter analyzes the mutually beneficial connection between generative AI and predictive analytics, their changing roles, and the groundbreaking opportunities they indicate for marketing in the years to come. For instance, to acquire a comprehensive image of consumer behavior, predictive analytics will have to be combined with a wide range of data sources, including social media, interactions, the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets, and augmented reality applications. Predictive models will be driven by current information feeds, providing marketers with the unmatched capacity to predict trends and consumer tastes. In addition, marketers will be able to comprehend complicated customer feedback with a combination of natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and predictive analytics, allowing customized and successful marketing campaigns. A new era of data-driven decision-making in marketing will be brought in by predictive analytics, which will develop applications that go beyond forecasting consumer actions to include supply chain management, risk assessment, and dynamic pricing optimization. On the other hand, generative AI offers an opportunity to redefine the boundaries of innovation and customization while democratizing the method of producing content. From highly customized ads to AI-generated descriptions of goods, creative AI algorithms will allow marketers to generate content at scale while maintaining authenticity and appropriateness. In addition, the boundaries between the real and the fake will be dissolved by the convergence of generative AI, augmented reality, and digital influencers, enabling comprehensive brand experiences that attract audiences in ways that were never before possible. As marketers travel into the untapped world of generative artificial intelligence, ethical questions about the confidentiality of information, bias in algorithms, and property rights become growing in significance. In conclusion, marketers must carefully embrace machine learning and generative artificial intelligence as they grow, finding a balance between innovation and responsibility in order to achieve these technologies’ full potential for impacting the future of marketing. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Hemachandran K, Debdutta Choudhury, Raul Villamarin Rodriguez, Jorge A.

However, influencers’ use of overly high-arousal language in promoting products (e.g., “it's totally AMAZING!”) has raised questions about their true motivations. This article investigates how high-arousal language in micro- versus macro-influencers’ sponsored posts might shape engagement. A multimethod approach, combining automated text, image, video, and audio analyses of thousands of Instagram and TikTok posts with controlled experiments, demonstrates that high-arousal language increases engagement with micro-influencers, but it decreases engagement with macro-influencers, seemingly because it makes micro- (macro-) influencers appear more (less) trustworthy. Yet the negative effect of arousal for macro-influencers can be mitigated if their posts provide counterbalanced valence (both positive and negative assessments) or if they indicate an informative, rather than commercial, goal. These findings deepen understanding of how language arousal shapes consumer responses, reveal a psychological mechanism through which language arousal affects perceptions, and provide actionable insights for crafting more effective social media content. © American Marketing Association 2024.","engagement; language arousal; micro- and macro-influencers; persuasion knowledge; social media; unstructured data analysis","","","","","","","","Ahluwalia R., Burnkrant R.E., Answering Questions About Questions: A Persuasion Knowledge Perspective for Understanding the Effects of Rhetorical Questions, Journal of Consumer Research, 31, 1, pp. 26-42, (2004); Ananthakrishnan U., Proserpio D., Sharma S., I Hear You: Does Quality Improve with Customer Voice?, Marketing Science, 42, 6, pp. 1143-1161, (2023); Banziger T., Scherer K.S., The Role of Intonation in Emotional Expressions, Speech Communication, 46, 3-4, pp. 252-267, (2005); Becker J.-M., Proksch D., Ringle C.M., Revisiting Gaussian Copulas to Handle Endogenous Regressors, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 50, 1, pp. 46-66, (2022); Berger J., Arousal Increases Social Transmission of Information, Psychological Science, 22, 7, pp. 891-893, (2011); Berger J., Humphreys A., Ludwig S., Moe W.W., Netzer O., Schweidel D.A., Uniting the Tribes: Using Text for Marketing Insight, Journal of Marketing, 84, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Berger J., Milkman K.L., What Makes Online Content Viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Berger J., Moe W.W., Schweidel D., What Holds Attention?

The literature has demonstrated that not only influencer attributes but also content characteristics impact follower behaviours. However, the activity of influencers continues to be predominantly described as a persuasion process aimed at engaging followers in behaviours desired by brands and influencers. Drawing upon e-service and influencer marketing literature, this study aims to broaden the exploration of the influencer category from an e-service perspective by investigating the role played by the evaluation of youtuber content in determining follower satisfaction and behaviours. The results show that four characteristics of a YouTube channel (information quality, entertainment quality, interactivity, and content originality) determine follower satisfaction. Furthermore, satisfaction and channel loyalty serially mediate the effect of the characteristics on behaviours related to the endorsed brand (purchase intention of sponsored brands) and the influencer channel (purchase intention of influencers’ brands, behavioural engagement). This study provides a new perspective on influencers by portraying them as service providers for both followers, serving as content creators, and for brands, acting as communication partners, rather than merely as persuaders. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2024.","Content creator; E-service; Influencer marketing; Purchase intention; Satisfaction; Youtube content characteristics","","","","","","Università di Catania, UNICT","Open access funding provided by Universit\u00E0 degli Studi di Catania within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

Leveraging their unique content and substantial follower base, brands benefit from innovative forms of consumer engagement above and beyond more traditional firm-driven approaches. Alongside the numerous human influencers, a new opinion leader-virtual influencers-entered the stage with early examples launched in 2016. Virtual influencers are computer-generated characters or avatars designed and maintained by experts and digital agencies that help brands appeal to and reach desirable target groups effectively through their digital personalities. Despite their potential impact, little is known to date about these virtual opinion leaders. The purpose of this chapter is to offer a detailed presentation of virtual influencers within their ecosystem, taking into consideration their human influencer counterparts as well as consumer perceptions. Building on an extensive review of the literature and exploratory interviews with a group of young consumers, we make specific recommendations for brands as to how to incorporate virtual influencers into their interactive marketing strategy. This chapter is concluded by offering avenues for future research to help scholars and practitioners interested in pursuing this area and boost their understanding of this innovative and promising digital entity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Avatar; Computer-generated images (CGIs); Influencer marketing; Interactive marketing; Social media influencer; Virtual influencer","","","","","","","","Akdevelioglu D., Kara S., An international investigation of opinion leadership and social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 1, pp. 71-88, (2020); Al-Emadi F.A., Ben Yahia I., Ordinary celebrities related criteria to harvest fame and influence on social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 2, pp. 195-213, (2020); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The future of social media in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 79-95, (2020); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Guidry Moulard J., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Aw E.C.-X., Chuah S.H.-W., Stop the unattainable ideal for an ordinary me!

To date, however, no research has quantitatively examined the impact of emotion in the facial expressions and caption text that influencers use in their video posts on consumer engagement through likes, comments, and views of posts. Grounded in consumer brand engagement, psychological sense of community, and the behavior ecology view of facial displays, this study uses social media analytics, facial expression analysis, and computational linguistic analysis to assess the emotional substance of 402 video posts by prominent micro-, macro-, and mega-influencer mothers, known as InstaMoms, as exemplars of Instagram influencers. The study identifies that the amount of emotion used and specific discrete emotions have a meaningful influence on engagement, and both follower count and presence of branding saliently contribute to a more robust understanding of the relationship. Theoretical and practical implications are identified and discussed. © American Marketing Association 2023.","advertising; consumer brand engagement; facial expression analysis; influencer marketing; linguistic analysis","","","","","","University of Alabama Department of Advertising and Public Relations","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Data collection was supported by the Lewis Research Grant from The University of Alabama Department of Advertising and Public Relations.

Design/methodology/approach: By following a purposive sampling strategy and collecting cross-sectional data from 379 valid responses in the UK, this study adopts structural equation modelling, artificial neural networks and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (SEM-ANN-fsQCA) as integrated methods for analysis. Findings: This study reveals that social status recognition, immersive enjoyment, gamified incentives, attachment to influencers and endorsements are critical antecedents that drive hedonic buying. Originality/value: In knowledge, this study concurrently adopts the perceived value theory and attachment theory that can enrich the inner elements and reveal the underlying connections under the theories. In method, the integrated analytical approach can explore deeper and more convincing results without the limitations of a single approach. In practice, this study helps practitioners ascertain customer perceptions of influencer endorsements and their attachment in the context of buying hedonically, thus developing effective strategies for employing influencers and marketing strategies to foster consumers’ hedonic buying behaviours. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attachment theory; Influencer endorsement; Perceived value; SEM-ANN-fsQCA; Social commerce","","","","","","","","Alba J.W., Williams E.F., Pleasure principles: a review of research on hedonic consumption, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 23, 1, pp. 2-18, (2013); Amirtha R., Sivakumar V.J., Building loyalty through perceived value in online shopping – does family life cycle stage matter?, Service Industries Journal, 42, 15-16, pp. 1151-1189, (2022); Armsden G.C., Greenberg M.T., The inventory of parent and peer attachment: individual differences and their relationship to psychological well-being in adolescence, Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 16, 5, pp. 427-454, (1987); Bi N.C., Zhang R., ‘I will buy what my “friend” recommends’: the effects of parasocial relationships, influencer credibility and self-esteem on purchase intentions, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 17, 2, pp. 157-175, (2022); Bitrian P., Buil I., Catalan S., Enhancing user engagement: the role of gamification in mobile apps, Journal of Business Research, 132, pp. 170-185, (2021); Bowlby J., The making and breaking of affectional bonds: I.

Survey responses collected from 316 Instagram users using systematic random sampling are analysed using structural equation modelling. The results delineate that SMIs’ credibility and SMI–consumer similarities have a significant positive effect on all consumer brand engagement (CBE) dimensions. However, informativeness of SMI’s content positively impacts cognitive and behavioural aspects, and not emotions, whereas content entertainment only enhances emotional engagement. The study provides insights to marketing practitioners for SMI selection and content design in order to achieve specific or multiple CBE goal(s). The results also confirm the indispensable mediating role of CBE dimensions in influencing consumers’ purchase intentions. This extends prior studies, which have predominantly explained these effects via mediators including consumer attitude and trust. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer brand engagement; influencer marketing; Social media","","","","","","","","Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two–step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Avery J., Glossier: Co-Creating a cult brand with a digital community, Harvard Business School Case, (2019); Ball-Rokeach S.J., Media system dependency theory, Theories of mass communication, pp. 297-327, (1989); Berne-Manero C., Marzo-Navarro M., Exploring how influencer and relationship marketing serve corporate sustainability, Sustainability, 12, 11, (2020); Bilal M., Jianqu Z., Ming J., How consumer brand engagement effect on purchase intention?

Drawing on both parasocial relationship and social identity theories, we investigate the relative effectiveness of brand-directed versus influencer-directed social media marketing in stimulating both customer engagement and purchase behaviour. First, we use a survey research design to collect data on customers’ intention to engage with the brand and purchase when exposed to brand-directed and influencer-directed social media marketing. Second, we collect data from a field experiment on a social media platform that captures customer engagement and brand sales at aggregate levels attributed to brand-directed and influencer-directed social media marketing. Consistently across both studies, we find that brand-directed and influencer-directed social media marketing positively impact customer engagement and customer purchase behaviour. Further evidenced across both studies, we find brand-directed social media marketing is more effective than influencer-directed social media marketing in fostering customer engagement, whereas influencer-directed social media marketing is more effective in driving customer purchases. We also find that female customers are more impacted by influencer-directed social media marketing on both dimensions than brand-directed social media marketing. The study provides a strategic direction for brands to optimally allocate their limited digital marketing budget between brand-directed and influencer-directed social media marketing based on their marketing objectives central to customer behaviour – either enhancing longer-term customer relationship building via engagement or generating shorter-term sales. © 2024 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.","brand sales; customer engagement; field experiment; influencer marketing; social media marketing","","","","","","","","Adweek, Agency highsnobiety just put TikTok’s favorite trainspotter in the conductor’s seat for Gucci, (2022); Aral S., Walker D., Creating social contagion through viral product design: A randomized trial of peer influence in networks, Management Science, 57, 9, pp. 1623-1639, (2011); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Moulard J.G., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Belanche D., Casalo L., Flavian M., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Understanding influencer marketing: The role of congruence between influencers, products and consumers, Journal of Business Research, 132, pp. 186-195, (2021); Berthon P., Pitt L., Plangger K., Shapiro D., Marketing meets web 2.0, social media, and creative consumers: Implications for international marketing strategy, Business Horizons, 55, 3, pp. 261-271, (2012); Bruce N., Foutz N., Kolsarici C., Dynamic effectiveness of advertising & word of mouth in sequential distribution of new products, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 4, pp. 469-486, (2012); Burt R., Brokerage and closure: An introduction to social capital, (2007); Carlson J., Hanson S., Pancras J., Ross W., Rousseau-Anderson J., Social media advertising: How online motivations and congruency influence perceptions of trust, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 21, 2, pp. 197-213, (2022); Casalo L., Flavian C., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Influencers on Instagram: Antecedents and consequences of opinion leadership, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 510-519, (2020); de Vries L., Gensler S., Leeflang P., Effects of traditional advertising and social messages on brand-building metrics and customer acquisition, Journal of Marketing, 81, 5, pp. 1-15, (2017); Dekker P., Uslaner E., Social capital and participation in everyday life, 23, (2003); Delbaere M., Michael B., Phillips B., Social media influencers: A route to brand engagement for their followers, Psychology & Marketing, 38, 1, pp. 101-112, (2021); Dessart L., Social media engagement: A model of antecedents and relational outcomes, Journal of Marketing Management, 33, 5-6, pp. 375-399, (2017); Devereux E., Grimmer L., Grimmer M., Consumer engagement on social media: Evidence from small retailers, Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 19, 2, pp. 151-159, (2020); Dibble J., Hartmann T., Rosaen S., Parasocial interaction and parasocial relationship: Conceptual clarification and a critical assessment of measures, Human Communication Research, 42, 1, pp. 21-44, (2016); Dolega L., Rowe F., Branagan E., Going digital?

Caruelle envelope symbolKristiania University College, Oslo, Norway","The rise of influencers on social media has created new opportunities for brands to advertise their products. However, the novelty of the influencer phenomenon is not always well understood, because influencer marketing resembles the well-established practice of celebrity endorsement. This chapter aims to demonstrate the specificities of the influencer phenomenon as a new form of opinion leadership. It conceptualizes this phenomenon as a triadic relationship between influencers, their followers, and the brands they endorse. This chapter examines the influencer-follower, influencer-brand, and follower-brand relationships involved in this triadic interplay. Drawing on the influencer marketing literature, it discusses how and why all three actors engage in a digitally mediated dialogue. This dialogue takes the form of likes, comments, tags, and other social media interactions, and it revolves around the content that influencers create and share with their followers in which they feature brands. All in all, marketing managers should not view influencer marketing as a mere substitute for celebrity endorsement. Rather, managers should acknowledge that the interactive nature of the influencer phenomenon has the potential to trigger brand-related conversations and instant sales. This chapter notably recommends two tactical marketing tools to trigger instant sales: shoppable posts and livestream shopping sessions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Brand engagement; Influencer marketing; Influencers; Social media","","","","","","","","Abidin C., Communicative intimacies: Influencers and perceived intercon-nectedness, Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, (2015); Abidin C., Visibility labour: Engaging with influencers’ fashion brands and #OOTD advertorial campaigns on Instagram, Media International Australia, 161, 1, pp. 86-100, (2016); Akdevelioglu D., Kara S., An international investigation of opinion leadership and social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 1, pp. 71-88, (2020); Al-Emadi F.A., Ben Yahia I., Ordinary celebrities related criteria to harvest fame and influence on social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 2, pp. 195-213, (2020); Arora A., Bansal S., Kandpal C., Aswani R., Dwivedi Y., Measuring social media influencer index-insights from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 49, pp. 86-101, (2019); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Moulard J.G., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Aw E.C.X., Labrecque L.I., Celebrity endorsement in social media contexts: Understanding the role of parasocial interactions and the need to belong, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 37, 7, pp. 895-908, (2020); Belanche D., Casalo L.V., Flavian M., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Understanding influencer marketing: The role of congruence between influencers, products and consumers, Journal of Business Research, 132, pp. 186-195, (2021); Belanche D., Flavian M., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Followers’ reactions to influencers’ Instagram posts, Spanish Journal of Marketing-ESIC, 24, 1, pp. 37-53, (2020); Caliandro A., Graham J., Studying Instagram beyond selfies, Social Media+ Society, 6, 2, pp. 1-7, (2020); Campbell C., Farrell J.R., More than meets the eye: The functional components underlying influencer marketing, Business Horizons, 63, 4, pp. 469-479, (2020); Casalo L.V., Flavian C., Ibanez-Sanchez S., Influencers on instagram: Antecedents and consequences of opinion leadership, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 510-519, (2020); Chae J., Explaining females’ envy toward social media influencers, Media Psychology, 21, 2, pp. 246-262, (2018); Chen T.Y., Yeh T.L., Lee F.Y., The impact of Internet celebrity charac-teristics on followers’ impulse purchase behavior: The mediation of attachment and parasocial interaction, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 15, 3, pp. 483-501, (2021); Childers C.C., Lemon L.L., Hoy M.G., # Sponsored# Ad: Agency perspective on influencer marketing campaigns, Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising, 40, 3, pp. 258-274, (2019); Correa S.C.H., Soares J.L., Christino J.M.M., de Sevilha Gosling M., Goncalves C.A., The influence of YouTubers on followers’ use intention, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 2, pp. 173-194, (2020); Cotter K., Playing the visibility game: How digital influencers and algorithms negotiate influence on Instagram, New Media and Society, 21, 4, pp. 895-913, (2019); De Veirman M., Cauberghe V., Hudders L., Marketing through Instagram influencers: The impact of number of followers and product divergence on brand attitude, International Journal of Advertising, 36, 5, pp. 798-828, (2017); Delbaere M., Michael B., Phillips B.J., Social media influencers: A route to brand engagement for their followers, Psychology and Marketing, 38, 1, pp. 101-112, (2021); Dinh T.C.T., Lee Y., “I want to be as trendy as influencers”-How “fear of missing out” leads to buying intention for products endorsed by social media influencers, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, (2021); Feng Y., Chen H., Kong Q., An expert with whom I can identify: The role of narratives in influencer marketing, International Journal of Advertising, 40, 7, pp. 972-993, (2020); Festinger L., A theory of social comparison processes, Human Relations, 7, 2, pp. 117-140, (1954); Godefroy J., Recommending physical activity during the COVID-19 health crisis.

This grounded theory study presents a paradigm for establishing and managing VIs based on eight semi-structured interviews with VI developers. It examines the design process, from elements (user-related and brand-related factors) to strategies (emphasizing aesthetic appeal, cultural codes, and background stories), which ultimately lead to business outcomes such as engagement, brand collaborations, and follower retention. Drawing on self-congruency and anthropomorphism theories, the study demonstrates that human-like behaviors in VIs—such as natural speaking and reacting—enhance trustworthiness, expertise, and appeal. Furthermore, it extends the anthropomorphism framework beyond the three-factor theory to incorporate cultural norms and desires.

A dataset of 255 influencers spanning a period of four years from the field of women’s fashion present on the social media platform Instagram has been used to empirically determine a model of an influencer’s relative importance in the network of its peers. By using regression analysis (panel and cross-sectional) as well artificial neural networks, the importance of the four main factors: followers, reach, engagement rate and posting frequency can consistently be established as well as their causal effects and the path dependency of an influencer’s importance across years. © 2024 Inderscience Publishers.

We present six studies that test the bad-influencer effect across multiple domains involving indulgence (vs. self-control): eating indulgent (vs. healthy) foods, spending time mindlessly (vs. mindfully), and using profane (vs. proper) language. Our findings show consumers are less willing to connect with people whose social media posts appear indulgent (vs. self-controlled) because they believe such posters will more negatively influence their own valued goals (i.e., interpersonal instrumentality expectations). We further identify two theoretically derived moderators of the bad-influencer effect: goal commitment amplifies the effect, whereas goal suppression attenuates the effect. Finally, we show that willingness to connect (WTC) has downstream consequences for consumers’ receptivity to word-of-mouth (WOM) recommendations made by posters. Our research suggests that content creators and marketing managers seeking to maximize connections should avoid sharing content that appears indulgent with respect to their target audience’s goals. © Academy of Marketing Science 2024.","Bad-influencer effect; Indulgence; Instrumentality expectations; Online engagement; Word-of-mouth","","","","","","John and Emiko Kageyama Endowment Fund","The authors would like to acknowledge and thank Eli J.

The effectiveness of posts published on such platforms is often measured by the extent to which those posts are reshared — something that can be shaped by the regional social and cultural context. This study examines regional variations in effective posts (formerly tweets) published on X (formerly known as Twitter) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on California’s two largest cities: Los Angeles and San Diego. By analysing a large dataset comprising the top 5,000 most reposted (formerly retweeted) posts from users in both cities, gathered between 17th March and 11th April, 2020, the research aims to identify key posters and content characteristics associated with higher repost rates. Employing techniques such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis, this study transforms unstructured text data into quantitative metrics in order to explore the relationship between content metrics and the number of reposts. The findings highlight the significant influence of local figures in shaping user engagement with shared posts spanning diverse topics and sentiments. These insights have significant implications for marketers, emphasising the importance of understanding local influencers, post topics and sentiment in geo-tagged posts. In regions with diverse populations, businesses can develop strategies to collaborate with local influencers and actively involve community leaders from various cultural backgrounds. By doing so, they facilitate the dissemination of trustworthy information and enhance engagement with culturally diverse audiences. Ultimately, this approach enables marketers to transform regional disparities into strategic advantages, fostering more effective communication and engagement on social media. © Henry Stewart Publications 2056-8002 (2024).","COVID-19; cultural variations; emotion analysis; influencers; sentiment analysis; topic modelling; Twitter; X.com","","","","","","","","Xue J., Chen J., Hu R., Chen C., Zheng C., Su Y., Zhu T., Twitter discussions and emotions about the COVID-19 pandemic: Machine learning approach, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22, 11, (2020); Gligoric K., Ribeiro M.

Building upon the Trust Transfer Theory, this study examined the values behind Instagram live streaming that could potentially build young consumers’ trust in and engagement with social commerce sellers. Known for its visually appealing content, simplicity, speed, and mobility, Instagram is unlike other social media platform. More importantly, its targeting ability makes it an influencer dominant social media platform. Analysis using dual-stage PLS-SEM and ANN from 209 respondents revealed that utilitarian and symbolic values significantly influence trust, which subsequently builds customer engagement. Hedonic values and economic values, on the other hand, were found to play no significant role in building trust and customer engagement. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2023.","Engagement; Instagram; Live streaming; Perceived (intangible) values; Social media influencers; Trust","","","","","","","","Addo P.C., Fang J., Asare A.O., Kulbo N.B., Customer engagement and purchase intention in live-streaming digital marketing platforms, Service Industries Journal, 41, 11-12, pp. 767-786, (2021); Arnold M.J., Reynolds K.E., Hedonic shopping motivations, Journal of Retailing, 79, 2, pp. 77-95, (2003); Arora A.D., Glaser P., Kluge A., Kim S., Kohlisak N., It’s showtime!

This article examines the dynamics of influencer marketing within the growing creator economy, emphasizing the interactions among firms, influencers, followers, and digital platforms. We introduce a novel, equity-driven framework that analyzes how influencers contribute to customer equity, how influencers manage and leverage the value from their followers, and how platforms maximize the value from their users. We detail the complex relationships and value exchanges within the influencer marketing ecosystem, highlighting the challenges of measuring the return on investment and influencers’ strategic use of content to maintain authenticity and influence. By synthesizing diverse academic literature and current industry practices, this manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of value creation and exchange in influencer marketing, offers strategic implications for marketers aiming to optimize their influencer engagements, and outlines future work in the form of the eleven “INFLUENCERS” research directions. © The Author(s) 2025.","Creator economy; Customer equity; Customer lifetime value; Followers; Influencer marketing; Platforms; Social media; User-generated content","","","","","","","","Abell A., Biswas D., Digital engagement on social media: How food image content influences social media and influencer marketing outcomes, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 58, 1, pp. 1-15, (2023); Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, pp. 634-653, (2010); Ascarza E., Netzer O., Hardie B.G., Some customers would rather leave without saying goodbye, Marketing Science, 37, 1, pp. 54-77, (2018); Audrezet A., De Kerviler G., Moulard J.G., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., How brands can build successful relationships with influencers, Harvard Business Review Online, (2019); Avery J., Gupta S., Brand positioning, Harvard Business School Note, (2014); Babic Rosario A., De Valck K., Sotgiu F., Conceptualizing the electronic word-of-mouth process: What we know and need to know about eWOM creation, exposure, and evaluation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, pp. 422-448, (2020); Babic Rosario A., Russell C.A., Shanahan D.E., Paradoxes of social support in virtual support communities: A mixed-method inquiry of the social dynamics in health and wellness Facebook groups, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 57, 1, pp. 54-89, (2022); Beichert M., Bayerl A., Goldenberg J., Lanz A., Revenue generation through influencer marketing, Journal of Marketing, 88, 4, pp. 40-63, (2024); Berman R., Katona Z., Curation algorithms and filter bubbles in social networks, Marketing Science, 39, 2, pp. 296-316, (2020); Bhargava H.K., The creator economy: Managing ecosystem supply, revenue sharing, and platform design, Management Science, 68, 7, pp. 5233-5251, (2022); Bleier A., Fossen B.L., Shapira M., On the role of social media platforms in the creator economy, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 41, 3, pp. 411-426, (2024); Brooks G., Drenten J., Piskorski M.J., Influencer celebrification: How social media influencers acquire celebrity capital, Journal of Advertising, 50, 5, pp. 528-547, (2021); Byun K.J., Ahn S.J., A systematic review of virtual influencers: Similarities and differences between human and virtual influencers in interactive advertising, Journal of Interactive Advertising, 23, 4, pp. 293-306, (2023); Cachon G.P., Lariviere M.A., Supply chain coordination with revenue-sharing contracts: Strengths and limitations, Management Science, 51, 1, pp. 30-44, (2005); Campbell C., Rapp Farrell J., More than meets the eye: The functional components underlying influencer marketing, Business Horizons, 63, 4, pp. 469-479, (2020); Cascio Rizzo G.L., Berger J., De Angelis M., Pozharliev R., How sensory language shapes influencer’s impact, Journal of Consumer Research, 50, 4, pp. 810-825, (2023); Cascio Rizzo G.L., Ordenes F.V., Pozharliev R., De Angelis M., Costabile M., How high-arousal language shapes micro-versus macro-influencers’ impact, Journal of Marketing, 88, 4, pp. 107-128, (2024); Chen X., Van Der Lans R., Phan T.Q., Uncovering the importance of relationship characteristics in social networks: Implications for seeding strategies, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 2, pp. 187-201, (2017); Chen L., Yan Y., Smith A.N., What drives digital engagement with sponsored videos?

Nowadays, many users generate contents on brands they like, or do not like, and share those opinions with other consumers from all over the world (Smith et al. 2012). In this environment, the opinion of some content providers has gained a lot of credit among their peers. Called “social media influencer (SMI),” their influence is such that before deciding to buy a product, some of their followers would systematically consult the SMI’s opinion (Moon and Han 2011). Brands did not fail to notice this particular influence and a vast majority of them seized the opportunity to develop partnerships with influencers to see their products praised by the SMI. The practice is called product placement (PP) (Russell 2002). Yet, the context of SMI presents several differences with that of traditional PP which suggest an original persuasion process that deserves scholar and managerial attention. First, the strength of the relationship between SMIs and their audience, relying on parasocial interaction (Lueck 2015), is quite unique in the marketing and advertising context, where audiences do not usually share a personal relationship with the source of the commercial message (Colliander and Erlandsson 2015). Second, SMIs endorse products at a pace that has never been considered before. They are “serial recommenders,” implying high frequencies of attempts of influence. Recommendations—of potentially different brands in the same product category—may impact subsequent ones in a looping mode. Third, the audience’s involvement in the communication and the PP is also unique: although targets of PP in movies do not watch movies for the PP, SMIs’ followers seek SMIs’ opinion on products and brands. Finally, most audiences do not clearly identify the commercial dimension behind a PP offered on social media (Boerman et al. 2017), which increases the effectiveness of the practice (Charry and Tessitore 2016) and calls for additional investigations on consumers literacy and empowerment. The objective of this work is to investigate the persuasion process at play in the very specific context of SMIs’ PP and to provide a better understanding of consumers’ responses and empowerment. In order to do so, we will focus on the relationship between SMI and their followers; followers’ attributions of SMI’s motivations; the impact of the repetitive dimension of the practice, also at different levels of satisfaction, especially on engagement; and factors of consumers’ empowerment.

To this end, social media influencers act as a dynamic third-party endorser to spread a brand's message to vast audience across the world. Consumers who exhibit a positive attitude towards the social media credibility are attracted through social media advertisements. The present study examines the perceptions of agencies for opting social media influencers and their role in customer engagement and brand awareness. For this purpose, the study also assesses different methods adopted by these influencers for influencing customers using a systematic review.

The primary data was collected through a structured questionnaire from 621 respondents from three Asian countries using the purposive sampling technique. Factor analysis was applied to analyse the interrelationship between digital footprints (DF), mobile application, and brand experience. Further, it also examines the role of brand engagement in determining brand vocal (BVOC), brand loyalty (BLOY), brand value (BVAL), and customer satisfaction. Results reveal that mobile app use significantly leads to higher brand engagement while brand experience and DI positively mediate and moderates this relationship. Brand engagement is a strong predictor of brand vocal, brand loyalty, customer satisfaction, and brand value. The outcome study helps promote brand engagement and other brand performance (BP) indicators through digital marketing to improve brand experience.

Female engagement is of paramount importance as recent reports indicate a concerning drop in women’s sport participation (CAAWS 2016; Canadian Heritage 2012). The sport of hockey is well entrenched in Canadian culture with hundreds of thousands of Canadians actively participating as players, coaches and officials (Hockey Canada 2017). This passion for hockey is spreading worldwide as the International Ice Hockey Federation reports over 1.7 million players (IIHF 2017). Minor hockey, men’s programs and high performance competition have traditionally enjoyed particular fanfare and broad support. The purpose of this research is to bring needed attention and understanding to a passionate group of women recreational players who are steadily growing in the shadows of mainstream hockey and who exert significant marketplace influence. This particular study is part of a progressive research project that was initiated in 2012 with a quantitative inquiry that profiled 781 women recreational hockey players. Output from these efforts revealed a passionate and influential group of hockey consumers with unique needs and considerations. Also discovered through this initial study was the growing skill gap and rising tension brewing among recreational players. In 2016, in-depth player interviews were conducted to better understand this tension and risk of conflict between young competitive- minded players and more mature recreationally-spirited players. The broad age range of participants in women’s recreational hockey coupled with the historical barriers to women’s active involvement in this sport, accentuate the probability of inter-cohort conflict and the need to better understand and manage such risks. This third phase of research reveals the most recent input from over 800 current or past women recreational hockey players in an effort to further profile and segment these evolving sport consumers in terms of influencers, perceived benefits, skill level, competitiveness, cohesiveness and sport commitment. Identified segments include social newbies, keener beginners, intermediates, still superstars and mellow competitors. While findings confirmed some persistent cohort differences, increasing similarities were also revealed with less than anticipated concerns regarding cohort conflicts. Further consideration is needed in addressing older participants’ insecurities, younger players’ quitting risks, and the ongoing management of skill level gaps. Output from this work is intended to influence the design of alternate playing options that will meet the needs, interests, and involvement of various player groups while ensuring a pleasurable and challenging sport experience for all. This learning can also be effectively extended to the management and marketing of other women’s and recreational sports. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Hockey; Recreation; Sport marketing; Women’s sport","","","","","","","","","D.L.

The main purpose of this research is to analyse whether anti-consumption-framed content (anti-hauls) generates more views, more dislikes (and less dislikes) and more comments, as customer engagement components, than pro-consumption-framed content (hauls). Design/methodology/approach: Based on 160 videos published on YouTube by 80 influencers on their respective channels, this study mainly analyses whether there are differences between anti-consumption and pro-consumption content in the various elements that constitute customer engagement (i.e. number of views, likes, dislikes and comments). Findings: Results indicate that there are differences between anti-consumption and pro-consumption content in terms of total number of views, likes, dislikes and comments. All these customer engagement components are higher for anti-consumption-framed videos, which offers interesting implications for both theory and practice. Originality/value: This study extends previous literature by accounting content published by social media influencers on their social media accounts, instead of analysing the most traditionally studied content that is published by brands on their own social media; and classifying this content as anti/pro-consumption rather than using the traditional dichotomy between transactional/emotional content. Brands should pay special attention to the content generated by social media influencers because it is a powerful form of electronic word-of-mouth that currently plays a significant role in customers’ (non)purchase decisions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anti-haul video; Earned social media; Engagement; Haul video; Online influencers; Online marketing; Social media marketing; YouTube","","","","","","CIMEDES; Mediterranean Research Center of Economics and Sustainable Development; Universidad de Almería, UAL, (ceiA3)","This work was supported by the Mediterranean Research Center of Economics and Sustainable Development (CIMEDES) and the University of Almería (Agrifood Campus of International Excellence, ceiA3).","Babic-Rosario A., de Valck K., Sotgiu F., Conceptualizing the electronic word-of-mouth process: what we know and need to know about eWOM creation, exposure, and evaluation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 3, pp. 422-448, (2020); Baek H., Oh S., Yang H., Ahn J., Electronic word-of-mouth, box office revenue and social media, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 22, pp. 13-23, (2017); Bagozzi R.P., Principles of Marketing Management, (1986); Bandura A., Social Learning Theory (Vol. 1), (1977); Bandura A., Social cognitive theory of mass communications, Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research (2nd ed.), pp. 94-124, (2009); Barger V., Peltier J.W., Schultz D.E., Social media and consumer engagement: a review and research agenda, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 10, 4, pp. 268-287, (2016); Barreto A.M., Ramalho D., The impact of involvement on engagement with brand posts, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 13, 3, pp. 277-301, (2019); Bi N.C., Zhang R., Ha L., Does valence of product review matter?

This article introduces the social customer journey, which extends prior perspectives on the path to purchase by explicitly integrating the important role that social others play throughout the journey. The authors highlight the importance of “traveling companions,” who interact with the decision maker through one or more phases of the journey, and they argue that the social distance between the companion(s) and the decision maker is an important factor in how social influence affects that journey. They also consider customer journeys made by decision-making units consisting of multiple individuals and increasingly including artificial intelligence agents that can serve as surrogates for social others. The social customer journey concept integrates prior findings on social influences and customer journeys and highlights opportunities for new research within and across the various stages.

However, few studies have explored how social media influencers, and more broadly, consumers, actively integrate resources to engage in service innovation in social commerce. This qualitative study (involving two firms and their influencers) examines the emerging roles of social media influencers and their resource integration behaviors in service innovation. Drawing on the service-dominant logic and the technology affordance theory, the study advances a framework that identifies the resource integration behaviors that underlie two primary roles of influencers—communicator and innovator—and explains how social media technology affordances facilitate these behaviors, and thereby, the ensuing innovation outcomes. By focusing on the technology-mediated processes of social media influencers’ engagement in service innovation, we contribute to research and practice in consumer-led service innovation in the emerging digital world. © 2022, The Author(s).","Service innovation; Social commerce; Social media influencers; Social media technologies; Technology affordances","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71802204, 71832014, 72032009)","This research is funded by research grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant # 71802204, 71832014 and 72032009).

In 2016, firms invested more than $80 billion on influential social media users (ANA 2018). These users are considered “influential” as they contribute to the formation of attitudes toward products and services of a large number of other social media users. The basic idea underlying this novel marketing communication technique is that influencers build a relationship over time with those who follow their social media pages and thereby gain their trust and confidence. However, despite its massive growth and promising advantages, influencer marketing is still a considerably underexplored technique. Prior research has focused on influencer authenticity (Audrezet et al. 2018), likeability (De Veirman et al. 2017), the credibility of influencer posts (Boerman et al. 2017), and success metrics of influencer campaigns (Gräfe and Greff 2018), while the dynamics of influencer-follower relationships remain unexplored. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a life-cycle model of such influencer–follower relationships. Our results indicate that several properties of the influencer–follower relationship reflecting relevance-related aspects (e.g., interest in the influencer) and follower engagement (e.g., liking and sharing influencer posts), as well as relationship (e.g., commitment and trust) and consumption-related (e.g., purchase intentions) variables display an inverted U-shaped pattern over four consecutive relationship stages, namely, the phases of analysis, affection, attenuation, and alienation. By establishing a model that describes the dynamic evolution of influencer–follower relationships and by testing it through a variety of relational variables, we contribute to a better understanding of the development of the relationship between influencers and their followers. From a practical perspective, our findings suggest that not the number of followers per se but the number of followers in the peak stage of the influencer–follower relationship (referred to as affection phase) should be considered a key figure when planning campaigns. In addition, organizations can monitor the relationship development over time and offer insights to influencers in order to keep them relevant to their followers. Furthermore, our stage classification scheme may help influencers to analyze their follower base and manage their follower portfolio. In order to remain attractive to marketers in the long run, our results suggest that influencers should aim at having an ample number of followers situated in earlier relationship stages, indicating that popular influencers should not rest on a large number of followers and stop acquiring new followers. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Influencer marketing; Influencer-follower relationship; Life-cycle model; Social media; Trust","","","","","","","","","S.

This paper aims to synthesize two motivational theories: uses and gratifications (U&G) theory and the technology acceptance model (TAM). Design/methodology/approach: A selective literature review was conducted to examine recent publications related to young consumers’ brand-driven engagement behavior on SMSs in which either TAM or U&G theory was applied. A three-stage method was used: an initial search was followed by vertical and horizontal searches and then a targeted search of scholarly publications. At each stage, the university’s library databases and Google Scholar were searched for relevant, mainly peer-reviewed articles, using appropriate filters and keywords. The articles’ references and the studies that cited those articles were added to the initially identified research pool (vertical search), coupled with publications of a similar nature based on keywords (horizontal search). The final stage, the targeted search, involved identifying and adding specific articles (e.g. literature reviews and integrated models). Findings: After a review of a significant number of U&G and TAM studies, similarities and differences of the two theories were identified, and an integrated operational framework was developed. Based on empirical findings of existing U&G and TAM studies, testable propositions were presented. Research limitations/implications: The proposed hybrid model and the associated propositions provide a research opportunity to empirically examine how young consumers’ motivational (i.e. motivating and demotivating) drivers, normative influence, perceived value and attitudes (toward brand content and engagement) predict intention or actual brand-related behavior on SMSs. Practical implications: Much of current research indicates that generations Y and Z (“digital natives”) spend considerably more time on SMSs than any of the older generations (“digital immigrants”). Thus, brands that aim to target this cohort need to develop successful engagement strategies (e.g. gamification and influencer marketing) on current and emerging SMSs. The suggested conceptualization provides guidelines for companies to effectively use such communication strategies to motivate young people to engage with their brands on sites such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Originality/value: A review of TAM research indicates that it lacks rich motivating/demotivating constructs, and thus borrows from other theories to complement this weakness. An examination of U&G frameworks, particularity Ducoffe (1996)-based models, indicates that these frameworks mainly test engagement with social media advertising but seldom other types of brand-driven engagement on SMSs. In addition, many U&G studies focus less than TAM studies do on outcome variables such as behavioral intentions and behavior. Thus, the authors propose a synthesized U&G and TAM framework that mitigates both theories’ weaknesses and builds on their strengths, enriching the growing research on brand-driven engagement behavior via SMSs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand choice; Brand engagement; Brand equity; Brand interaction; Generation Y; Generation Z; Social media advertising; Social media marketing; Social media sites; Social networking sites; TAM; Technology acceptance model; U&G; Uses and gratifications theory; Young consumers","","","","","","","","Abu-Ghosh D.H., Al-Dmour H., Alalwan A.A., Al-Dmour R.H., Factors affecting Jordanian consumers’ attitudes towards Facebook advertising: case study of tourism, Emerging Markets from a Multidisciplinary Perspective, pp. 285-302, (2018); Ahmed Q.M., Raziq M.M., The social media advertising model (SMAM): a theoretical framework, Journal of Managerial Sciences, 11, 3, pp. 117-144, (2018); Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Dwivedi Y.K., Algharabat R., Social media in marketing: a review and analysis of the existing literature, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 7, pp. 1177-1190, (2017); Alhabash S., Park H., Kononova A., Chiang Y.-H., Wise K., Exploring the motivations of Facebook use in Taiwan, CyberPsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 15, 6, pp. 304-311, (2012); Aluri A., Slevitch L., Larzelere R., The influence of embedded social media channels on travelers’ gratifications, satisfaction, and purchase intentions, Cornell Hospitality Quarterly, 57, 3, pp. 250-267, (2016); An D., Kim S.H., A first investigation into the cross-cultural perceptions of internet advertising: a comparison of Korean and American attitudes, Journal of International Consumer Marketing, 20, 2, pp. 49-65, (2007); Anderson M., Jiang J., Teens’ social media habits and experiences, Pew Research Center, (2018); Ansari A., Mela C.F., E-customization, Journal of Marketing Research, 40, 2, pp. 131-145, (2003); Apaolaza V., Hartmann P., Medina E., Barrutia J.M., Echebarria C., The relationship between socializing on the Spanish online networking site Tuenti and teenagers’ subjective wellbeing: the roles of self-esteem and loneliness, Computers in Human Behavior, 29, 4, pp. 1282-1289, (2013); Arteaga S.R., Duarte H.A., Motivational factors that influence the acceptance of moodle using TAM, Computers in Human Behavior, 26, 6, pp. 1632-1640, (2010); Asher S.R., Paquette J.A., Loneliness and peer relations in childhood, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 12, 3, pp. 75-78, (2003); Assimakopoulos C., Antoniadis I., Kayas O.G., Dvizac D., Effective social media marketing strategy: Facebook as an opportunity for universities, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 45, 5, pp. 532-549, (2017); Athwal N., Istanbulluoglu D., McCormack S.E., The allure of luxury brands’ social media activities: a uses and gratifications perspective, Information Technology and People, (2018); Audrezet A., De Kerviler G., Moulard J.G., Authenticity under threat: when social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, (2019); Azar S.L., Machado J.C., Vacas-de-Carvalho L., Mendes A., Motivations to interact with brands on Facebook–towards a typology of consumer–brand interactions, Journal of Brand Management, 23, 2, pp. 153-178, (2016); Baccarella C.V., Wagner T.F., Kietzmann J.H., McCarthy I.P., Social media?

Changes in the way Millennials think accompanied by an explosion of social media have led to an increased focus on social media influencer marketing in the company sector. To help establish a new marketing paradigm that accounts for these changes, this research aims to conceptualize and investigate the process of building consumer-brand relationships with Millennial consumers through social media micro-influencers. Findings based on structural equation modeling revealed that four core characteristics of social media micro-influencers (i.e., authenticity, the meaning of the influencer, specific content, and secret sharing) were a significant antecedent of brand engagement and brand love, which, in turn, mediated the pathway from social media micro-influencer characteristics to brand evangelism. Understanding what social media micro-influencers mean to Millennials offers the promise of improving brand evangelism through more precise market analysis and market strategy. In the discussion, the paper introduces a three-stage building method towards brand evangelism through social media micro-influencer, including: (1) the stage of selecting influencers; (2) the stage of constructing intense emotional responses to the brand (brand engagement and brand love); and ultimately (3) the stage of becoming a brand evangelist. Lastly, limitations and future directions were discussed. © 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

In addition, the paper inspects the influence of para-social relationships on consumers brand in addition to the influence of social media platform type in moderating the effect of personality on para-social relationships and COBRA. A conceptual framework is developed to demonstrate the proposed relationships. Data was collected using online questionnaires, with 180 valid responses. The results suggest that user-influencer personality congruence is a salient predictor of para-social relationships and COBRA and that para-social relationship(s) have a substantial impact on customer brand engagement. Nevertheless, the results also indicated that social media platform type do not influence the relationship between congruity and para-social relationships or COBRA.

This study addresses this gap and extends previous research by examining factors that influence consumers’ intentions to engage in s-commerce in four countries: Chile, Spain, South Africa and Australia. Specifically, this study develops and tests a model of consumers’ intentions to engage in s-commerce through brands’ Facebook pages incorporating personal variables (involvement in brands’ products and services, satisfaction with brands’ Facebook page), trust variables (message credibility of Facebook posts, trust in firms’ Facebook) and social variables (peer communication, social media dependency, online social interaction propensity) on predicting intentions to purchase products and services through brands’ Facebook pages if s-commerce was available to them. The findings show that the main drivers of s-commerce engagement are message credibility, trust in the brands’ Facebook, involvement, peer communication and online social interaction propensity, as influencers of consumer satisfaction with brands’ Facebook and social media dependency, which in turn drive intentions to engage in s-commerce. Contributing to theory and practice, these relationships are discussed for the four countries involved in the study. © 2017 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","consumer behaviour; Facebook; s-commerce; Social commerce; social media","","","","","","","","Andrews L., Bianchi C., Consumer internet purchasing behavior in Chile, Journal of Business Research, 66, 10, pp. 1791-1799, (2013); Andrews L., Kiel G., Drennan J., Boyle M., Weerawardena J., Gendered perceptions of experiential value in using Web-based retail channels, European Journal of Marketing, 41, 5-6, pp. 640-658, (2007); Araujo T., Neijens P., Friend me: Which factors influence top global brands participation in social network sites, Internet Research, 22, 5, pp. 626-640, (2012); Arbuckle J., Amos 6.0 user’s guide, (2005); Bagozzi R.P., Phillips L.W., Representing and testing organizational theories: A holistic construal, Administrative Science Quarterly, 27, pp. 459-489, (1982); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., Phillips L.W., Assessing construct validity in organizational research, Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, pp. 421-458, (1991); Bai Y., Yao Z., Dou Y.-F., Effect of social commerce factors on user purchase behavior: An empirical investigation from renren.com, International Journal of Information Management, 35, pp. 538-550, (2015); Ball-Rokeach S.J., The origins of individual media-system dependency: A sociological framework, Communication Research, 12, 4, pp. 485-510, (1985); Ball-Rokeach S.J., A theory of media power and a theory of media use: Different stories, questions, and ways of thinking, Mass Communication and Society, 1, 1-2, pp. 5-40, (1998); Ball-Rokeach S.J., DeFleur M.L., A dependency model of mass media effects, Communication Research, 3, pp. 3-21, (1976); Barnes N.G., Social commerce emerges as big brands position themselves to turn “follows”, “likes” and “pins” into sales, American Journal of Management, 14, 4, pp. 11-18, (2014); Bart Y., Shankar V., Sultan F., Urban G.L., Are the drivers and role of online trust the same for all web sites and consumers?

Replacing traditional customer relationship management (CRM) with a Facebook fan site (for instance) presents advantages but also strategic risks for a brand. If knowledge of brand advocates, High-Value Customers, High-Value Prospects and influencers is considered an asset for the business, the asset needs to be owned and managed over time, and that is not possible in the social-only environment. Social and CRM in combination are likely to be more effective than individually. In linking social data with CRM data, multiple identities, privacy and data protection issues, and which data to hold on the database (vs. leave in the social media cloud) are all challenges that need to be addressed. The social customer relationship management (SCRM) strategy will be driven by marketing, but will have an impact through all the business functions from customer service through to brand marketing. Eight stages of the SCRM strategy are outlined from Listen and Learn through to 'Measure and Evaluate'. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","consumer engagement; CRM; customer database; customer relationship management; social CRM; social media","","","","","","","","Pezzi R., Information Technology Tools for A Transition Economy, (2009); QCi Chapter 3?, (2005)","N.

With the growing interest in virtual influencers, this study aims to investigate why social media users would interact with virtual influencers. The research model was developed based on the self-congruity theory. The data were obtained by questionnaires distributed to social media users using judgmental sampling (respondents were above 18 years old and actively used Instagram within the past six months). The questionnaire was posted on social media, and 230 responses were collected and analyzed using a covariance-based structural equation. Influencer-brand fit was found to have a weak direct effect on engagement (γ = 0.158, p < 0.05), but insignificant direct effect on mimicry desire (γ = 0.160, p > 0.05). Value homophily significantly affects both engagement and mimicry desire directly (β = 0.338 and β = 0.622, p < 0.01). Moreover, value homophily was found to fully mediate the virtual influencer-brand fit/mimicry desire relationship (B = 0.546, p < 0.01) and partially mediate the relationship of virtual influencer-brand fit/engagement (B = 0.229, p < 0.01). However, the mediating effect of mimicry desire on the virtual influencer-brand fit/engagement relationship was found to be non-significant (B = 0.065, p > 0.05). This study contributes to influencer marketing by highlighting value homophily as the most significant factor explaining why consumers respond to a virtual influencer when used as a message source in marketing communication. © Lokweetpun Suprawan, Sasipa Pojanavatee, 2022.","consumer response; influencer; marketing communication; message source; Thailand","","","","","","","","Aaker D.

In line with the social identity theory, this paper examines the effects of consumers' perceived source credibility of UGC in YouTube videos on their attitudes and behavioral intentions. Additionally, source homophily theory is included to predict the antecedent of source credibility. Design/methodology/approach: Three hundred and seventy two Generation Y respondents were interviewed using snowball sampling. Data were analyzed with component-based structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: Findings confirmed that perceived source credibility indirectly affects purchase intention (PI) and electronic word-of-mouth via attitude toward UGC. Besides, perceived source credibility mediates the effect of perceived source homophily on attitude toward UGC. Practical implications: Since today's consumers have begun to trust and rely more on UGC than company-generated content on social media when making purchase decisions, companies may reconsider democratizing certain aspects of their branding strategies. Firms may fine-tune their marketing communication budgets – not only just by sponsoring public figures and celebrities but also by nurturing coproductive engagements with independent content creators who are ordinary consumers. Endowed with their imposing credibility, these micro-influencers and prosumers have high potentials to be uplifted to brand ambassadors. Originality/value: While consumers' purchase outcome can be measured easily using metrics and analytics, the roles of source homophily in stages leading up to the purchase is still elusive. Drawing on the rich theoretical basis of source homophily may help researchers to understand not only how credibility and attitude are related to PI but also how this nexus generates positive word of mouth among UGC followers within the social media circles. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Influencer marketing; Social media marketing; Source credibility; Source homophily; User-generated content; Word-of-mouth marketing","","","","","","Office of the Deputy; Research Management Centre; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM, (600-IRMI/MyRA 5/3/LESTARI 028/2017)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Research Management Centre, Office of the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Research and Innovation), Universiti Teknologi MARA Malaysia (LESTARI grant no.: 600-IRMI/MyRA 5/3/LESTARI 028/2017).

Narver Chair in Business Administration, University of Washington, United States","Influencer marketing initiatives require firms to select and incentivize online influencers to engage their followers on social media in an attempt to promote the firms’ offerings. However, limited research considers the costs of influencer marketing when evaluating these campaigns’ effectiveness, particularly from an engagement elasticity perspective. Moreover, it is unclear whether and how marketers could enhance influencer marketing effectiveness by strategically selecting influencers, targeting their followers, or managing content. This study draws on a communication model to examine how factors related to the sender of a message (influencer), the receiver of the message (influencer's followers), and the message itself (influencer's posts) determine influencer marketing effectiveness. The findings show that influencer originality, follower size, and sponsor salience enhance effectiveness, and posts that announce new product launches diminish it. Several tensions arise when firms select influencers and manage content: Influencer activity, follower–brand fit, and post positivity all exert inverted U-shaped moderating effects on influencer marketing effectiveness, suggesting that firms that adopt a balanced approach along these dimensions can achieve greater effectiveness. These novel insights offer important implications for marketers designing influencer marketing campaigns. © American Marketing Association 2022.","consumer engagement; influencer marketing effectiveness; marketing strategy; online influencers; social media","","","","","","Lingnan University, LU, (DB21A7, DR21B3)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Lingnan University Direct Grant, Lingnan University Faculty Research Grant (grant number DR21B3, DB21A7).

The findings suggest that sponsored blogging affects online engagement (e.g., posting comments, liking a brand) differently depending on blogger characteristics and blog post content, which are further moderated by social media platform type and campaign advertising intent. When a sponsored post occurs on a blog, high blogger expertise is more effective when the advertising intent is to raise awareness versus increase trial. However, source expertise fails to drive engagement when the sponsored post occurs on Facebook. When a sponsored post occurs on Facebook, posts high in hedonic content are more effective when the advertising intent is to increase trial versus raise awareness. The effectiveness of campaign incentives depends on the platform type, such that they can increase (decrease) engagement on blogs (Facebook). The empirical evidence for these findings comes from real in-market customer response data and is supplemented with data from an experiment. Taken together, the findings highlight the critical interplay of platform type, campaign intent, source, campaign incentives, and content factors in driving engagement. © American Marketing Association 2019.","advertising campaign intent; brand engagement; consumer decision journey; influencer marketing; social media influencers; social media platform; social network sites; sponsored bloggers","","","","","","Marketing Science Institute, MSI","The authors gratefully acknowledge the data provided by The Motherhood and funding provided by a Marketing Science Institute grant.

In the light of the emerging digital space for new forms of marketing, the traditional servicescape concept is critically examined. This paper aims to show why servicescape concepts and attitudes need to be adapted for digital media. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors explain how the traditional servicescape concept adds meaning to a service provider’s value-proposition by modifying customer expectations and customer experience. Second, recognising that the environment for service is no longer bound to a physical place, the authors discuss the implications of the epistemic shift involved. Findings: The authors’ examination shows that digital service space challenges traditional concepts about what constitutes a customer experience and derived value. The authors conceptually “zoom out” into a virtual service eco-system and show with exemplar examples why the servicescape in digital space is more socially embedded and necessarily more fluid in its time-space design. In the more advanced sites, interactions between various artificial bodies (avatars) are co-created by controlling off-line participant-actors; yet, these participant-actors remain strangers to each other at an off-line level. This is entirely a new and radical development of old times. Research limitations/implications: The research findings are based on scholarly research of the relevant literature, from practitioner reports, and evidence emerging from the examination of many digital web-sites. It has not been the authors’ intention to objectively represent current servicescape functionalities but more to indicate the major directions of change with exemplar examples. The future cannot be predicted, but their interpretive conclusions suggest major challenges in service marketing and management logic ahead. New forms of digital servicescape are still being created as technology and service imagination enables, so further research interest in virtual atmospherics can be expected. Practical implications: Social media platforms are enabling organisations to learn more about their customers and also to engage them more. In these changing times, bricks and mortar stores would be well advised to review their servicescape presence to allow and encourage engagement with the more involved consumers. And, by integrating their digital space into their physical place, bricks and mortar stores might take on more relationship oriented process-like characteristics, both in the digital space and in their physical places, with developments on one platform leading to possible service innovations on the other. Social implications: The digital era is changing consumer behaviour. Service managers need to take into account that many customers are already equally as engaged with digital-space social networks as they once were with bricks and mortar stores. The more time consumers as participant-actors spend in social networks, the decision on what and where to buy is decided by interactions with friends and other influencers. Originality/value: New forms of digital servicescape are being created as technology and service imagination enables. Further scholarly research interest in virtual atmospherics can be expected, impacting on the authors’ sense of place, and self-identity. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Avatars; Digital service-space;

Furthermore, its (in)direct influence on affective attitude, price perception and loyalty is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted. First, an experimental scenario design was set up to investigate the hypothesized relations between customer engagement; customers’ affective attitude and their loyalty; and their price perceptions. Second, a survey at a national forest park center helped to secure external validity. Findings: The results indicate that engaged customers develop a more positive affective attitude, which leads to increased future loyalty and positive price perceptions. In addition, the results suggest that assessing cognitive approaches exclusively is not sufficient for understanding customers’ price perceptions. Research limitations/implications: Future research should investigate antecedents of customer engagement behaviors (CEBs) other than satisfaction, and extend this research by taking into account further mediators that might be cognitive rather than affective. Practical implications: The results are of superior importance for services or tourism destinations. Fostering CEB can help in improving a destinations’ performance. Originality/value: This research expands the current state of literature by investigating several dimensions of CEB at one time, as well as by examining customers’ affective attitude toward the organization as a potential mediator, extending previous research approaches. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affective attitude; Customer engagement; Engagement; Loyalty; Price perception; Tourism; Tourism","","","","","","","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Anderson E.W., Customer satisfaction and word of mouth, Journal of Service Research, 1, 1, pp. 5-17, (1998); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the use of structual equation models in experimental designs, Journal of Marketing Research, 26, 3, pp. 271-284, (1989); Beckers S.F., van Doorn J., Verhoef P., Good, better, engaged?

Prior research, through the lens of service-dominant logic, has conceptualised fans as active, commanding and critical influencers, revealing complex, multifaceted and developing co-creative relationships, but invariably only with their teams, clubs and online communities, limiting what is currently known about fans, sponsors and co-creation. Given this gap, the current study seeks to explore the perceptions and antecedents of this relationship across European football leagues with an emphasis on understanding perspectives on user generated advertising, developing social media content, creating brand culture and new product/services development for sponsoring brands. Exploratory in outlook, the paper adopts a social constructionist position, utilising 296 participants, from 9 leagues and incorporating 59 clubs. The study reveals the dynamic nature of the fan/co-creation relationship, with data indicating that fanatical and regular fans view co-creation as a cynical, intrusive and disruptive process, while casual fans seem more willing to engage, albeit episodically and driven by the anomalous emotions of guilt and superstition. The paper uncovers behaviours that offer insight for both brand managers and clubs into the reality of fan engagement in the context of co-creation. This offers a contribution to theory by positing five new behavioural categories related to perception of and engagement with co-creation activity: Defectors, Rejecters, Absorbers, Moralisers and Repenters. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand community;

The purpose of this article was to review the published literature on influencer marketing, conduct a content analysis of the academic literature, and furnish a classification based on different parameters. The content analysis led to a distribution of articles as per eight different categories. This article provided the first such literature review of influencer marketing literature for the period from 2008 – 2019 to analyze and present the trends of this new marketing tactic, industries and fields involved, different platforms of social media used, key areas and methods employed by the social media influencers to connect with their followers, and spread a brand message. It was found that the major focus areas and industries utilizing social media influencers (SMIs) for brand messages and engagement of the digital consumers are lifestyles, fashion, and beauty. Empirical research was found to be predominant during the period under study. The most popular issues in the recent studies were self-presentation, para-social interactions, para-social relationships, and the credibility of the SMIs. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 20,000 microblogs were collected from Irish fashion micro-influencers and analyzed through keyword classification and content analysis in NVivo. The determinants of eWOM persuasiveness for consumer engagement on social media were investigated based on Sussman and Siegal’s information adoption model. Findings: The study finds that among the four types of micro-influencers, market mavens and their eWOM messages have the highest impact on consumer engagement on social media, and it presents a repetitive and persuasive eWOM model of market mavens to increase consumer participation. Also, the study discovers that micro-influencers’ occasion-related microblogs have an increasing impact on consumer interactions whereas microblogs with brands have a decreasing engagement with consumers on social media. Originality/value: This study advances prior studies on the relationship between influencers’ eWOM messages and consumer participation on social media by the development of a persuasive eWOM model of micro-influencers to increase consumer engagement and fill in the lack of relevant literature. Also, findings provide actionable insights for marketing communication practitioners to persuade consumers to participate in eWOM communications and establish strong consumer-brand relationships on social media. © 2021, Zheng Shen.","Consumer engagement; eWOM persuasiveness; Fashion micro-influencers; Interactive marketing; Microblogging; Social media","","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The author would like to thank the editors, Prof Cheng Lu Wang, Prof John Schibrowsky and Dr Morgan Yang, and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions on this study.

An analysis of Rare Pride conservation campaigns shows the quantitative, replicable relationship among the impact of these conservation campaigns with diffusion of innovation theory, and collective behavior theory that can guide marketers to set better goals. Rare is an environmental conservation organization that focuses on reducing community-based threats to biodiversity through a social marketing campaign called Pride. Pride campaigns work by removing barriers to change (whether they are technical, social, and political or something else) and inspiring people to make change happen. Based on the analysis of historical Pride campaign survey data, we found that the starting percentage of engagement has a great influence on the percentage change at the end of the campaign: The higher the initial adoption level of knowledge, attitude, and behavior change, the easier these measures are to improve. The result also suggests a difference in the potential of change with different audience segments: It is easiest to change influencer, then general public, and finally resource user who are the target of the social marketing campaign. In this article, we will analyze how to use diffusion of innovation and collective behavior theories to explain the impact of campaigns, as well as how to set more attainable goals. This article is consistent with similar research in the field of public health, which should help marketers set goals more tightly, allocate resources more effectively, and better manage donor expectations. © The Author(s) 2012.","Best practices; Environment; Innovations; Monitoring and evaluation; Other practice areas; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Bass F., A new product growth for model consumer durables, Management Science, 15, pp. 215-227, (1969); Cialdini R.B., Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, (1984); Hassinger E., Stages in the adoption process, Rural Sociology, 24, pp. 52-53, (1959); Hayden D., Setting Smart SMART Goals, (2012); Jenks B., Vaughan P.W., Butler P.J., The evolution of Rare Pride: Using evaluation to drive adaptive management in a biodiversity conservation organization, Evaluation and Program Planning, 33, pp. 186-190, (2010); McKenzie-Mohr D., Smith W., Fostering Sustainable Behavior, An Introduction to Community-based Social Marketing, (1999); Olson M., Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and The Theory of Groups, (1965); Rogers E., Diffusion of Innovation, (2003); Schelling T.C., Micromotives and Macrobehavior, (1978); Snyder L.B., Meta-analysis of mediated health campaigns, Mass Media Effects Research: Advances Through Meta-analysis, pp. 327-344, (2007); Snyder L.B., Hamilton M.A., A meta-analysis of the effect of mediated health communication campaigns on behavior change in the United States, Journal of Health Communication, 9, pp. 71-96, (2004)","D.

In addition to SMI selection criteria such as number of followers, costs per post, engagement rate or audience characteristics, practitioners are also confronted with the decision problem of choosing the type of SMI based on their origin of fame, which refers to the way SMIs became known to their audience. Two types of SMIs can be distinguished based on their origin of fame. The first type is celebrities who became famous outside of social media (e.g., by being singers, actors or athletes). Because these SMIs have a non-social media origin of fame, they are referred to as “non-original SMIs”. The second type is celebrities who became famous in social media (e.g., by presenting their lifestyle). Because these SMIs have a social media origin of fame (e.g., “instafamous”), they are referred to as “original SMIs”. To explain the effects of SMIs’ origin of fame on social media users’ purchase behavior, this study draws on the concept of identification. In this context, identification is defined as the adoption of attitudes and behaviors of media personae through the process of social influence. With similarity and wishful identification, two distinct types of identification have been discussed in the literature. While the object of similarity identification are media personae that are similar to actual self of the media user, the object of wishful identification are media personae that are similar to the ideal self of the media user. In which type of identification media users engage depends on their level of self-esteem. While the favorite media persona of media users with low self-esteem is closer to their ideal self (i.e., wishful identification), the favorite media persona of media users with high self-esteem is closer to their actual self (i.e., similarity identification). This study investigates if social media users’ self-esteem moderates the effect of SMIs’ origin of fame on social media users’ purchase behavior. It thus aims to examine the effectiveness of the type of SMI based on social media users’ self-esteem. The results of an online experiment with 129 social media users in Russia reveal that non-original SMIs affect social media users’ purchase intentions stronger than original SMIs if social media users have low self-esteem. In contrast, original SMIs affect social media users’ purchase intentions stronger than non-original SMIs if social media users have high self-esteem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Influencer marketing; Origin of fame; Self-esteem; Social media; Social media influencer","","","","","","","","","R.

No discipline has benefitted from another as much as marketing from psychology. To gain an understanding of the scientific contributions emerging from the intersection of psychology and marketing, this study conducts a bibliometric retrospection of a premier journal dedicated to the application of psychological theories and techniques to marketing: Psychology & Marketing (P&M). To do so, this study employs bibliometrics to unpack the publication trends and the intellectual structure of P&M. In doing so, this study reveals several interesting findings. First, P&M's publications grew by 71.9 times, authorships grew by 82.1 times, and citations grew by 150.8 times between 1984 and 2020, indicating a healthy growth of marketing research informed by psychology. Second, P&M's contributions manifest through eight intellectual clusters—namely, marketing environment; consumer engagement; online consumer behavior and marketing; luxury consumption and marketing; sustainable consumption and marketing; influencer and international marketing; customer relationship, satisfaction, and loyalty; and marketing futures. Finally, P&M's emerging and promising areas for future exploration include aesthetics and consumer impressions; celebrity endorsement; conspicuous consumption and hedonic adaptation; climate change; choice likelihood; consumer engagement; consumer psychology; marketing communication; sensory marketing; sharing economy; and social media marketing. As a whole, these findings should provide readers with a state-of-the-art overview of marketing from psychology through the scientific contributions from P&M. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","bibliometric;

Given an abundance of micro influencers to choose from, cues that help distinguish more versus less effective influencers on social media are of increasing interest to marketers. The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a social media user’s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets). They identify a theoretically important mechanism underlying the effect: following fewer others conveys greater autonomy, a signal of influence in the eyes of others. © American Marketing Association 2020.","autonomy; following; micro influencer; opinion leader; social media","","","","","","","","Aral S., Identifying Social Influence: A Comment on Opinion Leadership and Social Contagion in New Product Diffusion, Marketing Science, 30, 2, pp. 217-223, (2011); Aral S., Walker D., Identifying Influential and Susceptible Members of Social Networks, Science, 337, 6092, pp. 337-341, (2012); Baer R., Hinckle S., Smith K., Fenton M., Reactance as a Function of Actual versus Projected Autonomy, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 38, 3, pp. 416-422, (1980); Barker S., Using Micro-Influencers to Successfully Promote Your Brand, Forbes, (2017); Bellezza S., Gino F., Keinan A., The Red Sneakers Effect: Inferring Status and Competence from Signals of Nonconformity, Journal of Consumer Research, 41, 1, pp. 35-54, (2014); Berger J., Barasch A., A Candid Advantage?

The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) asserts widespread advertiser and publisher agreement regarding clear and prominent disclosure that native ads are paid content. The disclosures are important because they help prevent scrutiny about whether native advertising is misleading or deceptive, which could trigger policy intervention. However, by definition, native ads, including their disclosures, are designed to match the experience provided by other content. So, it is not clear (a) if consumers know native ads are sponsored content or (b) whether consumers care about the source of the content. Thus, the initial research questions are How are advertisers using native advertising? How are they disclosing their sponsorship of the content? To begin to address this gap in our understanding of native advertising, the article begins with a report of current native advertising formats and practices. It then reviews 122 examples of native ads from identified native advertising leaders over a 31-day period on October 2014. The report summarizes ad format (video, content, picture), industries that used native ads, the amount of engagement with the content during the 31-day period, and, perhaps most importantly, how the sponsorship was disclosed in each case. Most native ads that were recognized were in-stream ads that used words (vs. video or pictures). However, videos had higher levels of engagement (as measured by social media). Videos also seemed more likely to use celebrities and emotional appeals. Technology companies were the dominant users of native ads during the time period. Substantial variation existed in words used, shading, colors, capitalization, contrast between text and background color, font size, and timing/placement of disclosures. The manuscript contributes to the conceptualization of native advertising, provides an overview of disclosures currently used, and provides directions for next steps and future inquiry by marketers, policy makers, and policy influencers. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science.","","","","","","","","","","H.A.

Given the growing B2B digital engagement, cues that help to differentiate highly impactful digital influencers are crucial for vendor companies. Drawing from Stereotype Content Model, we analyze competence and warmth as relevant cues of digital influencers. Employing experimental studies, we examine how competence and warmth influence B2B purchasing managers' evaluation and selection of vendors' solutions. We find that the digital influencers' competence enhances purchasing managers' intention to buy the advocated vendor's offering. When compared with warmth, competence minimizes capability and relational concerns associated with the purchase decision. Further, we show that such effect of competence is prominent when manager-influencer identification is low. Our research advances knowledge on the characteristics of digital influencers that shape B2B purchasing managers' evaluation and selection of vendors.

Instagram involvement is examined as an applied moderator in the proposed theoretical model of this research. Methodology: To test the hypotheses of the research, an experimental study was conducted. The sample was formed by female participants who were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions (fit of influencer–product vs fit of celebrity–product). Findings: The results showed the superiority of the fit of influencer–product over the fit of celebrity–product on users’ engagement. It also indicates that highly involved Instagram users (vs lowly involved Instagram users) moderate the more prominent effect of the fit of influencer–product post on users‘ engagement. Practical implications: The research helps brands to increase their knowledge of marketing campaigns formed through the fit of the opinion leaders with the products promoted. Value: This research in addition to highlighting the role of users involved with Instagram contributes to a better understanding of the importance of promotional post fitting. © 2021, Arash Ahmadi and Siriwan Ieamsom.","Celebrity; Celebrity fit; Engagement; Influencer; Influencer fit; Instagram; Instagram involvement; User engagement; Willingness to like; Willingness to share","","","","","","","","Aaker J.L., Dimensions of brand personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 347-356, (1997); Achouri M.A., Bouslama N., The effect of the congruence between brand personality and self-image on consumers’ satisfaction and loyalty: a conceptual framework, IBIMA Business Review Journal, 2, 2, pp. 34-49, (2010); Algesheimer R., Dholakia U.M., Herrmann A., The social influence of brand community: evidence from European car clubs, Journal of Marketing, 69, 3, pp. 19-34, (2005); Amornpashara N., Rompho N., Phadoongsitthi M., A study of the relationship between using Instagram and purchase intention, J.

Methodology: Time series of daily sales between the years 2017 and 2019 of 10 retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector were considered. Methods based on machine learning were used and the forecasting models were increased with numerical variables from the official profile of the company, from the posting made by the contracted digital influencer and the characteristics of the images posted by the digital influencer were included in the models. Relevance and Originality: The study is innovative, as it goes beyond qualitative reflections on the theme and provides empirical evidence regarding the impacts on forecast accuracy from the inclusion of social media variables. A data fusion strategy (numerics and images) was also presented to forecast daily sales of retail companies in the beauty and cosmetics sector. Main results: The models proved to be efficient in forecasting and the importance of the likes and engagement variables reinforces the idea that the identification and social reference generated by the ID are important aspects in the purchase decision process. It was found that the images are responsible for adding exclusive attributes that help in forecasting and understanding the patterns of the sales series. Theoretical and methodological contributions:The study showed in a promising way the efficiency of methods based on machine learning in forecasting sales from Instagram data, especially with regard to the incorporation and extraction of image data. © 2021 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

Emojis have become quintessential elements of social media communication; yet, their role in supporting persuasion attempts has not been systematically analysed. Drawing on general rhetoric literature, this paper dissects, portrays and labels social media influencers’ persuasive attempts to initiate engagement through emojis. The focus on influencers is justified because of their dual roles as marketers and active social media users. 600 Weibo posts by the top 200 Weibo influencers were collected to develop a taxonomy of emoji-based verbal moves aimed at encouraging responses in followers. The resulting taxonomy demonstrates that emoji use by social media influencers is complex and strategic and serves multiple persuasive and communicative purposes. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","emoji; influencer; Marketing rhetoric; social media; social media marketing; taxonomy","","","","","","","","Ai W., Lu X., Liu X., Wang N., Huang G., Mei Q., Untangling emoji popularity through semantic embeddings, Paper presented at the ICWSM, (2017); Aldunate N., Gonzalez-Ibanez R., An integrated review of emoticons in computer-mediated communication, Frontiers in Psychology, (2016); Anderson M., Why sarcasm is such a problem in artificial intelligence, (2016); Austin J.L., How to do things with words, (1962); Bach K., Harnish R., Linguistic communication and speech acts, (1979); Bakshy E., Hofman J.M., Mason W.A., Watts D.J., Everyone’s an influencer: Quantifying influence on twitter, The Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining, (2011); Bauer M.W., Gaskell G., Qualitative researching with text, image and sound.

Using grounded theory in the context of transformational and charismatic leadership, a model is proposed for examining a marketer’s capacity to inspire. Along with its proposed antecedents and outcomes, inspirational motivation was tested on a dyad of 171 influencer/content evaluators. Results confirmed that inspirational motivation drives social media influence. Inspirational motivation, in turn, is directly influenced by humor, visionary insights, and engagement. Results also showed support for the mediating influence humor has on visual storytelling and inspirational motivation.

Focus of the Article: This case study applies Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) to reduce marine wildlife net entanglement in the waters surrounding Masirah Island, a marine biodiversity hotspot in Oman. Importance to the Social Marketing Field: The study demonstrates the use of social marketing tools in biodiversity conservation, bringing new knowledge to the cross-application of these two fields. Methods: The CBSM methodology was applied to select behaviours, identify barriers and benefits, develop strategies and design a pilot study. The responsible disposal of derelict nets in skip bins was selected as the target behaviour, and a mix of behavioural change tools was applied to achieve change: convenience (installation of three skip bins), education (installation of informative signs, distribution of awareness posters, one-to-one engagement with fishers on the beaches), prompts (installation of signs and posters on vessels) and social norms (one-to-one engagement with key influencers and decision makers). The monitoring of behaviour change took place through structured observations over 23 weeks, focussing on the number of nets disposed of in the allocated skip bins. Results: Results showed a low level of behaviour adoption rate by skiff and launch vessel fisheries, respectively, 5.36% and 2.58%. Positive results were observed for a short time but did not reach the estimated target value throughout the study period. Recommendations for Research: Our pilot study did not lead to broad-scale implementation and we recommend further awareness and engagement with the target audience, trials of various behaviour change tools and increase field monitoring time. We further recommend the application and funding of behaviour change methods applied to fishers with the incorporation of conventional financial, conservation and regulatory tools to support resource management. Limitations: Our results show that focussing on specific behaviours with appropriate measurement is both resource and time demanding to solve pressing conservation problems, particularly ones generated by complex industries such as fishing. Various lessons, useful for other social marketers, have been drawn from our evaluation of the overall study. © The Author(s) 2021.","behaviour change; community-based social marketing; marine wildlife; net entanglement; Oman","","","","","","Environment Authority; Environment Society of Oman; Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs; Oman Environmental Holding Services; Icelandic Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture; Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries (Tunisia), MARHP","Funding text 1: This project has been funded by Renaissance Services SAOG and was implemented by The Environment Society of Oman (ESO).

Design/methodology/approach: Using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) with content analysis, the authors examine over 20,000 online communication posts to identify prospects’ needs and communication styles that may inform brand ambassadors’ outreach efforts. Findings: Analysis reveals linguistic differences between brand ambassadors’ and prospective students’ posts across public and private spaces, suggesting gaps in exchange efficacy. Publicly, prospects express more positive emotion, affiliation and authenticity than in private posts, where posting engagement is the highest. Prospects overall low clout language, combined with brand ambassadors’ low authenticity scores, suggest limited influence in exchange efforts. Theoretically, findings suggest that given the hedonic nature of public exchanges, this is where brand ambassadors may be more influential than in private, utilitarian informational exchanges. An integrated influencer marketing servicescape model is developed to guide future research. Originality/value: Findings extend and integrate the online servicescape and influencer marketing literatures by revealing the importance of service interaction context and linguistic styles in enhancing frontline informational exchanges. Aligning linguistic language such as analytical thought, clout, authenticity, emotional tone, temporal focus and affiliation between public and private contexts may enhance authenticity in frontline service interactions, thereby enhancing communication effectiveness. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand ambassadors; Brand communities; Influencer marketing; Marketing communications; Relationship marketing; Social media","","","","","","","","Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of C2C communications in online Brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 634-653, (2010); Ahearne M., Bhattacharya C.B., Gruen T., Antecedents and consequences of customer-company identification: expanding the role of relationship marketing, Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, 3, pp. 574-585, (2005); Aksoy L., Guilloux L., Duneigre H., Keita S., Service research priorities–bridging the academic and practitioner perspectives, Journal of Services Marketing, 33, 5, pp. 626-631, (2019); Alexander M.J., Jaakkola E., Hollebeek L.D., Zooming out: actor engagement beyond the dyadic, Journal of Service Management, 29, 3, pp. 333-351, (2018); Argo J.J., White K., Dahl D.W., Social comparison theory and deception in the interpersonal exchange of consumption information, Journal of Consumer Research, 33, 1, pp. 99-108, (2006); Arguello J., Butler B., Joyce E., Kraut R., Ling K.S., Wang X., Talk to me: foundations for successful individual-group interactions in online communities, CHI 2006, (2006); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: an exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology & Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Bartel C.A., Social comparisons in boundary-spanning work: effects of community outreach on members’ organizational identity and identification, Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, 3, pp. 379-413, (2001); Batra R., Ahuvia A., Bagozzi R., Brand love, Journal of Marketing, 76, 2, pp. 1-16, (2012); Baumeister R.F., Hutton D.G., Self-presentation theory: self-construction and audience pleasing, Theories of Group Behavior, pp. 71-78, (1987); Baumeister R.F., Leary M.R., The need to belong: desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, Psychological Bulletin, 117, 3, pp. 497-529, (1995); Belch G.E., Belch M.A., Advertising and Promotion: An Integrated Marketing Communications Perspective 11th Edition, (2019); Bettman J.R., Luce M.F., Payne J.W., Constructive consumer choice processes, Journal of Consumer Research, 25, 3, pp. 187-217, (1998); Bitner M.J., Servicescapes: the impact of physical surroundings on customers and employees, Journal of Marketing, 56, 2, pp. 57-71, (1992); Blazevic V., Wiertz C., Cotte J., De Ruyter K., Keeling D.I., GOSIP in cyberspace: conceptualization and scale development for general online social interaction propensity, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 28, 2, pp. 87-100, (2014); Brodie R.J., Hollebeek L.D., Smith S.D., Customer engagement: conceptual domain, fundamental propositions, and implications for research, Journal of Service Research, 14, 3, pp. 252-271, (2011); Capraro A.J., Patrick M.L., Wilson M., Attracting college candidates: the impact of perceived social life, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 14, 1, pp. 93-105, (2004); Carpenter J., Green M., Laflam J., Just between us: exclusive communications in online social networks, The Journal of Social Psychology, 158, 4, pp. 405-420, (2018); Cicala J.E., Smith R.K., Bush A.J., What makes sales presentations effective – a buyer-seller perspective, Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 27, 2, pp. 78-88, (2012); Collins N.L., Miller L.C., Self-disclosure and liking: a meta-analytic review, Psychological Bulletin, 116, 3, pp. 457-475, (1994); Doh S.J., Hwang J.S., How consumers evaluate eWOM (electronic word-of-mouth) messages, CyberPsychology & Behavior, 12, 2, pp. 193-197, (2009); Fagerstrom A., Ghinea G., Co-creation of value in higher education: using social network marketing in the recruitment of students, Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, 35, 1, pp. 45-53, (2013); Feldman R.S., Forrest J.A., Happ B.R., Self-presentation and verbal deception: do self-presenters lie more?, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 24, 2, pp. 163-170, (2002); Fujita M., Harrigan P., Soutar G.N., Capturing and co-creating student experiences in social media: a social identity theory perspective, Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 26, 1-2, pp. 55-71, (2018); Gao Z., Scorpio E.A., Does puffery deceive?

Specifically, it focuses on how endorser-caused engagement translates to online store performance. The authors examine metrics that capture short-term performance (online shop visits and immediate sales) by tracking immediate responses to social media posts. They conduct an empirical analysis based on real Facebook posts published over 1.5 years by a leading European online fashion retailer that targets young adults. To confirm results and shed light on the underlying mechanisms, the authors further conduct a randomized online experiment (N = 305) that mimics the field study. They find that influencer endorsements are associated with increased engagement and that engagement is associated with higher online store performance. The results show that endorsement negatively moderates the effect of engagement because it distracts from the products (i.e., the “vampire effect”). The authors conclude that consumers’ underlying intentions of engaging with social media posts vary, which implies that engagement caused by an endorser has less economic value than engagement motivated by other (e.g., product-related) reasons. From a practical perspective, social media brand post endorsement should be considered a tool for brand marketing rather than for performance marketing, and social media metrics should be interpreted with care, because not all engagement may help online store performance. © American Marketing Association 2022.","conversions; endorsement; engagement; influencer; sales; social media","","","","","","","","Ahluwalia R., How Prevalent Is the Negativity Effect in Consumer Environments?, Journal of Consumer Research, 29, 2, pp. 270-279, (2002); Ajzen I., The Theory of Planned Behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akpinar E., Berger J., Valuable Virality, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 2, pp. 318-330, (2017); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The Future of Social Media in Marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 79-95, (2020); Atkin C., Block M., Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsers, Journal of Advertising Research, 23, 1, pp. 57-61, (1983); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Moulard J.G., Authenticity Under Threat: When Social Media Influencers Need to Go Beyond Self-Presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, September, pp. 557-569, (2020); Benoit K., Watanabe K., Wang H., Nulty P., Obeng A., Muller S., Et al., Quanteda: An R Package for the Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data, Journal of Open Source Software, 3, 30, (2018); Berger J., Word of Mouth and Interpersonal Communication: A Review and Directions for Future Research, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 586-607, (2014); Berger J., Heath C., Where Consumers Diverge from Others: Identity Signaling and Product Domains, Journal of Consumer Research, 34, 2, pp. 121-134, (2007); Bergkvist L., Taylor C.R., Leveraged Marketing Communications: A Framework for Explaining the Effects of Secondary Brand Associations, AMS Review, 6, 3-4, pp. 157-175, (2016); Bergkvist L., Zhou K.Q., Celebrity Endorsements: A Literature Review and Research Agenda, International Journal of Advertising, 35, 4, pp. 642-663, (2016); Brown D., Hayes N., Influencer Marketing: Who Really Influences Your Customers?, (2015); Bruner G.C., Kumar A., Web Commercials and Advertising Hierarchy-of-Effects, Journal of Advertising Research, 40, 1-2, pp. 35-42, (2000); Choi S.M., Rifon N.J., It Is a Match: The Impact of Congruence between Celebrity Image and Consumer Ideal Self on Endorsement Effectiveness, Psychology & Marketing, 29, 9, pp. 639-650, (2012); Chu X., Liu Y., Chen X., Ling H., Whose and What Content Matters?

Previous research has examined to find out the optimal seeding strategy that yields the best outcome from the campaign. This research explores the relationships between the characteristics of the seeded influencer and user engagement. The data consists of information from 1062 seeded Instagram posts posted in September 2020 in Korea and 778 seeded influencers who posted those contents. Analyzed by negative binomial regression, our quadratic model suggests that the relationship between user engagement and the number of followers of the seeded influencer draws an inverted U-shape, indicating influencers with greater number of followers may not always be the best choice for the marketers. Moreover, this research shows that the negative marginal impact coming from the huge number of followers can be attenuated when the influencer is an expert of the seeded product. © 2022, Korean Marketing Association.

They are digital natives perplexing the marketing world to develop effective digital advertising strategies because they have become expert at avoiding digital advertising designed to influence their consumer behavior. Using a digital distraction during an advertisement is a Millennial behavior and they are not likely to read, listen to, or watch digital advertisements in their entirety. Marketers are challenged to uncover new insights relating to how to hold Millennial attention with digital marketing/advertising communication. This research explored questions on how marketers can better serve the Millennial consumer in the United States with digital marketing/advertising communication that is engaging, informative and influential to their consumer behavior. The research also explored similarities and differences in digital marketing/advertising engagement among Millennials and the Generation Z age cohort because Generation Z represents the largest age cohort coming of age. The research was conducted using the qualitative methods of focus groups, an online bulletin board and one-on-one in-depth interviews. The findings suggest that digital marketing/advertising that is short, with music, humor and the use of social media influencers has a positive impact on both age cohorts. © 2021 Korean Scholars of Marketing Science.","advertising; communication; digital; Generation Z; marketing; Millennial","","","","","","","","Marketing fact pack 2018, (2018); (1992); Bernard H.R., Ryan G.W., Analyzing qualitative data: Systematic approaches, (2010); Boyatzis R.E., Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, (1998); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101, (2006); Creswell J.W., Research design: Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches, (2009); Daugherty T., Hoffman E., Kennedy K., Nolan M., Measuring consumer neural activation to differentiate cognitive processing of advertising, European Journal of Marketing, 52, 1, pp. 182-198, (2018); (2015); Average estimated income of Americans in 2015, by generation (in U.S. dollars), In Statista - The Statistics Portal; Faseeh A.B., Mohammad F.K., Impact of social media marketing on brand experience: A study of select apparel brands on facebook, Vision, 22, 3, pp. 264-275, (2018); (2017); Fromm J., Read A., Marketing to GenZ, the rules for reaching this vast and very different generation of influencers, (2018); Holmes E., The new style influencers are digital; brands court stars with active audiences to try turning followers into shoppers, Wall Street Journal (Online), (2013); Husain S., Ghufran A., Chaubey D.S., Relevance of social media in marketing and advertising, Splint International Journal of Professionals, 3, 7, pp. 21-28, (2016); Katherine T.S., Longitudinal study of digital marketing strategies targeting millennials, The Journal of Consumer Marketing, 29, 2, pp. 86-92, (2012); Lazazzera M., The anxiety of influence, Financial Times, (2018); Mariampolski H., Qualitative market research, a comprehensive guide, (2008); Merriam S.B., Qualitative research: A guide to design and implementation, (2009); Nielsen A.C., Millennials on Millennials, (2017); Pileliene L., Grigaliunaite V., The effect of female celebrity spokesperson in FMCG advertising: Neuromarketing approach, The Journal of Consumer Marketing, 34, 3, pp. 202-213, (2017); Robson C., Real world research, (2002); Seger K., The Electronic Bulletin Board, PC Magazine, 1, pp. 214-220, (1983); Solomon M., Consumer behavior: Buying, having and being, (2017); Strauss A.L., Corbin J.M., Basics of qualitative research: Techniques and procedures for developing grounded theory, (1998); Tang Q., Chen X., Hu J., Liu Y., Priming the secure attachment schema affects the emotional face processing bias in attachment anxiety: An fMRI research, Frontiers in Psychology, 8, (2017); (2018); Millennials are the largest generation in the U, (2018); Todorovic D., W.

One of the strategies is to embed live customer service platforms into e-commerce websites. Live help service is distinguished from other online consumer support functions in that consumers interact directly with human or computerized customer service representatives using an online medium (Aberg and Shahmehri 2003). This study aims to shed light on how live customer service provides online shoppers with greater narrative engagement on e-commerce websites. Moreover, we explore individual difference in locus of control (LOC) (Potosky and Bobko 2001; Griswold 1983), which moderates the effect of control on engagement. Through an online experiment, this study examines the relationship between control over information received during live chatting and consumer narrative engagement. A total of 371 college students were recruited as study participants. The results show that when having the chance to choose what types of information to get, online consumers will be more engaged in the interactions with live sales agents. Furthermore, locus of control plays an influential role in aspects of online shopping. Customers with high internal locus of control generally feel highly engaged in chatting with live sales agents, regardless of the availability to choose information type. On the contrary, external LOC consumers will find it hard to concentrate on the conversations with live agents if they don’t get to choose the topic. The study has three major contributions. First, this study supports Busselle and Bilandzic’s (2009) emphasis on the importance of how information is communicated. Our findings indicate that same set of information generates different feelings for consumers when the ways of information delivery are different. Second, the analysis further contributes to the literature on digital consumer experience by investigating narrative engagement as one unique aspect of it. Control over information received from online interaction is identified as an important influencer of consumer engagement. Third, it deepens the understanding of digital communication through the less examined role of live customer service. Our findings demonstrate that merely pushing information through live customer service might upset a certain group of online shoppers, in our case, external LOC consumers. We suggest giving autonomy for consumers to decide on live chat topics. Practically, our research helps marketers and e-commerce brands better understand and utilize live help service as a new technological tool. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.","","","","","","","","","","D.

Utilizing a dataset of 557 posts from 37 pet influencers, we apply Uses and Gratifications Theory and Persuasion Knowledge to suggest textual and visual cues within sponsored posts are capable of disrupting engagement behaviors when consumers are seeking entertainment. We find evidence that sponsorship disclosures, mentions of money, brand logos, and overall saturation of sponsorship content reduce engagement.

The unorthodox approach of attracting the masses has considerably increased online purchase intentions. Especially during the global pandemic COVID-19, consumer’s high inclination towards online buying has been regarded as a natural phenomenon. Therefore, it remains eminent to determine that what factors boost buying intentions of the consumers during pandemic. In this regard, sequential mediation role of brand engagement, brand attitude and brand expected value were taken into consideration for precise examination of consumer online buying journey. Conceptually knitted associations were determined using positivist doctrine. The data was collected from 287 online apparel shoppers. Structural equation modelling (SEM) technique was executed for determining cause and effect relationships among the constructs.

The attributes giving influencers this power, especially on Instagram, where a single post can cost up to $1.2 million, need examination. Three models have been proposed for the understanding of attributes accountable for brand communicators’ persuasiveness/effectiveness. These models required integration and testing in the context of Instagram influencers, brand engagement and millennials. Considering that South-Africa’s large number of millennials are significantly drawn to famous influencers on social media, this study extended Ohanian’s (1990) integrated source credibility model to examine Instagram influencers’ attributes impacting millennials’ brand engagement. Data was quantitatively collected from 330 millennials in a socio-economically and culturally diverse university. Structural equation modelling results revealed that influencers’ trustworthiness, familiarity, similarity and likability were significant drivers of brand engagement. Likability’s impact was surprisingly negative. Expertise and attractiveness did not impact brand engagement significantly.

Findings show that there is a positive relationship between BESC and post engagement.

Media channels provide a means of communicating and influencing consumers’ perceptions and purchasing decisions. The rise of social media has gained the attention of consumers who are increasingly turning away from traditional media. Within this context, new methods of promoting products, such as influencer marketing, have emerged. Today’s consumers expect more from advertising than traditional promotional methods, and are seeking interaction and engagement. They like to follow the lives of other people, such as friends, celebrities and subject matter experts, and are influenced by their own preferences and suggestions. A successful campaign reaches as many product-related customers as possible and influences them. This can be achieved by influencer marketing through social media, which has become essential to companies’ marketing strategies. This paper takes a deeper look at the strategy of using social media influencers and its contribution to brand awareness. It presents real examples of influencer marketing campaigns and discusses the factors behind their success. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Brand influencers; Influencer marketing; Influencers; Social media marketing; Word-of-mouth marketing","","","","","","","","Myhrman H., This is the difference between paid and earned influencer marketing, (2019); Mindruta R., Interview: Eight key influencer marketing questions with industry expert Philip Brown, (2017); Savidge A., Ultimate guide to-influencer marketing:What you need to know, (2019); The history of influencer marketing, (2019); The state of influencer marketing 2019: Benchmark report, (2019); Influencer marketing 2019: Key statistics from our influencer marketing survey, (2019); DeBroff S., 5 ways influencer marketing transforms retail sales, (2016); Haversjo A., Understanding the negative implications of influencer marketing, (2019); 10 types of social media influencers you can work with, (2019); Bhat U., Top 8 types of influencer marketing campaigns, (2018); Djafarova E., Rushworth C., Exploring the credibility of online celebrities’ Instagram profiles in influencing the purchase decisions of young female users, Computers in Human Behavior, 68, pp. 1-7, (2017); Blight M.G., Ruppel E.K., Schoenbauer K.V., Sense of community on Twitter and Instagram: Exploring the roles of motives and parasocial relationships, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 20, 5, pp. 314-319, (2017); Tran G.A., Strutton D., Has reality television come of age as a promotional platform?

For this marketing practice to be successful, extant research has shown that a certain degree of congruence between the influencer image and the brand endorsed is necessary. This congruence has so far been studied as textual congruence. However, as influencer marketing is increasingly conducted via image-sharing platforms, such as Instagram, where influencers create visually appealing content to engage with their followers, we lack a way to identify and evaluate the role that visual congruence between brand and influencers play in driving the followers engagement. In this paper, we apply deep learning and image recognition algorithms on a large sample of images from Instagram, to extract a suitable measure of visual congruence as emerging from the automated analysis of brand and influencers images posted overtime. The algorithm is presented in detail along with examples of top and worst ranked brand-influencer visual congruences. To validate our measure, we run a multiple linear regression analysing the influencer post engagement levels against the brand-influencer visual congruence measure. Evidence is found of a significant impact of the brand-influencer visual congruence on the followers level of engagement on influencers posts endorsing a brand. Implications for academics and practitioners are drawn. © 2022 Authors.

Even as regulatory authorities call on brands and influencers to disclose the posts as advertising, no consistent guidelines exist. The distinct effects of self-generated versus platform-initiated disclosures also remain unclear, nor has research addressed the interplay of key influencer characteristics and marketing disclosures. This article reports on findings from the first academic field study of influencer marketing disclosures, as well as three experimental studies, which indicate that disclosure is a double-edged sword. When provided through a platform-initiated branded content tool, disclosure consistently exerts the strongest effect on perceptions of advertising, negatively relating to influencer trustworthiness and consumer engagement. The effects of disclosure type also depend on the number of followers and number of previously endorsed products (i.e., influencer characteristics). Yet, consumers also express appreciation for transparency when influencers disclose posts as advertising, which increases perceived trustworthiness of the influencer and engagement with the post. The implications of these findings should inform choices by public policy makers, brand managers, and influencers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Advertising transparency; Disclosure; Influencer marketing; Instagram; Multiple product endorsement","","","","","","UNSW Mini Marketing Conference","The authors thank Arne Thomas and Simon Scherzer for their help in the selection of the stimuli and recruiting participants for Study 2.

Migrant consumers as consumers in mobility that are constantly engaged in reterritorialization dynamics in different countries may find in social media platforms and in influencers effective ways to relocate in transition. The aim of this paper is to understand how influencers and technomediated sociality shape the construction of migrant consumers' identity by relocating it between country of origin and country of destination. We conducted a focused netnographic study of selected influencers' profiles followed by first- and second-generation migrant consumers. Findings reveal that influencers play a cultural mediator role for migrant consumers that facilitates their acculturation process to the new country. Thanks to technomediated platforms, influencers represent accessible sources that can trigger mimicry and doppelgänging effects. Additionally, our findings show the engagement of influencers in queerbaiting efforts: while showing ethics, social responsibility and civic engagement as ways of identity construction, self-expression and social aggregation they also achieve reterritorialization with their new country. This study offers theoretical contributions to consumer culture literature as related to migrant consumers' acculturation processes. It also advances our understanding of how influence dynamics in social media platforms shape the process of identity construction during transitions and relocations. © 2020 Societa Editrice Il Mulino.

Celebrity sponsorships are used to strengthen fan patronage since they enhance the level of engagement that fans have with the product, building image and reputation. Schaefer and Keillor (1997), Bush, Martin and Bush (2004), Braunstein and Zhang (2005) and Tingchi Lui, Yu-Ying & Minghua (2007) confirm the advertising benefit that companies gain through the use of celebrity figures in marketing campaigns. Through celebrity marketing the brand acquires a positive and elevated meaning of the product portfolio line being endorsed (Madrigal, 2001). Brand community membership is developed in response to the social identity that individuals place on being affiliated to sporting events and the sense of community that is developed by fans when attending sport events such as Wimbledon in tennis. This paper investigates sporting celebrity brand images and the effect of celebrity endorsement on brand choice. The perceived images of two contrasting sports stars within each of two sports (tennis and Formula One motor racing) are evaluated, and the effects of their potential endorsement explored for a range of products, in order to evaluate and compare the extent to which the benefits of celebrity endorsement can be stretched. The research methodology involved collection of both primary and secondary data. The web archives of one UK broadsheet newspaper (The Guardian) and one UK tabloid newspaper (The Daily Mirror) were searched for articles, blogs and associated comments relating to the four spotsmen, either from the start of their professional career or as far back as available. The websites and archives of the celebrity magazines “Now” and “Heat” were also searched for any references to the sportsmen, and the sportsmen’s own web pages were perused. These enabled the researchers to build a picture of each sportsman’s brand image and how celebrity endorsement power might have changed over time. This information was used to develop the measurement instrument. The questionnaire design was modelled around conceptual structures that support a variety of academic theoretical arguments. Primary research was carried out using an internet questionnaire developed using the software package Qualtrics. The design of the questions had two objectives; to explore respondents’ perceptions of the sportsmen, and to investigate the effect of links between sports, stars and brands. The questionnaire was administered through Facebook links and e-mails to friends, family and colleagues. Respondents were requested to complete the survey and then pass the link on to others. The survey was available for a total of 12 days. The final sample consisted of 102 respondents, 54 males and 48 females. 52% stated they were interested in tennis, 42% in motor racing, and 79% in sport in general. The findings suggest that there is a high level of association between celebrity profile, product, and brand choice. Endorsement of a product relevant to the sportsperson’s own sport was effective, while endorsement of a product relating to the contrasting sport was not. However differences were observed in the endorsement evaluation effect between the two sports disciplines; F1 drivers were perceived more strongly than tennis players as celebrities, and appeared to have greater value as endorsers of a product unrelated to sport. Findings further confirm the positive associations generated in the mind of consumers when marketing companies use role models as tools for enhancing a consumer’s expectation of a product or service. This can lead to brand and product spillovers, given that consumers’ purchase of a non-sports related product such as a mobile phone appears to be influenced by sport celebrity endorsement. Consequently, purchasing intent is not restricted to the purchase of sports products, but is rather determined by the cool image that the celebrity endorsement gives to the product. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science.","Brand Choice; Brand Image; Customer Relationship Management; Sport Discipline; Tennis Player","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","","","","","","23636165","","","","English","Dev.

However, there is little research on the impact of social media influencers on consumer brand engagement. To fill this gap, this chapter develops a conceptual framework to examine the impact of the endorsement by social media influencers on online brand engagement. The authors use social distance theories to construct several propositions to provide a deep understanding. They suggest that traditional celebrities and social media influencers have different social distance, therefore generate different types and degrees of consumer online engagement. And the product characteristics moderate the effectiveness of the different types of celebrity endorsement. © 2018 by IGI Global.

The social media, being second generation (Web 2.0) internet applications, allow interaction, one-to-one communication, customer engagement, and user generated content. The interest of higher education institutions in social media as part of the marketing toolkit is increasing, but little is known about the potential of these channels in higher education marketing strategies. Even less is known about the role of social media as influencers of future students in the choice of study and university. This article presents the results of a study identifying the role and importance of social media on the choice of future students for a study and university in comparison with the traditional university marketing channels in the Netherlands. The study identifies and describes three market segments among future students based on their use of the social media. © 2013 by IGI Global.

SMIs have an existing relationship of trust with consumers, and consumers seek out the content created by SMIs for valuable information and advice. This study explores the process of brand engagement between consumers and brands in the digital content marketing environment, specifically examining the research question: Do SMIs act as a route to brand engagement for their followers? The context for this study is the beauty community on YouTube; over 60,000 user comments were analyzed through automated text analysis. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence that SMIs do act as a route to brand engagement through the three dimensions of cognitive processing, affection and activation. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","automated textual analysis; brand engagement; social influence; social media marketing","","","","","","","","ASCI e-business report 2018-2019, (2019); Audrezet A., Kerviler G., Guidry Moulard J., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, (2018); Balabanis G., Chatzopoulou E., Under the influence of a blogger: The role of information-seeking goals and issue involvement, Psychology & Marketing, 36, pp. 342-353, (2019); Barry T.E., In defense of the hierarchy of effects: A rejoinder to Weilbacher, Journal of Advertising Research, 42, 3, pp. 44-47, (2002); Berryman R., Kavka M., I guess a lot of people see me as a big sister or a friend: The role of intimacy in the celebrification of beauty vloggers, Journal of Gender Studies, 26, 3, pp. 307-320, (2017); Boerman S.C., Willemsen L.M., Van Der Aa E.P., This post is sponsored: Effects of sponsorship disclosure on persuasion knowledge and electronic word of mouth in the context of Facebook, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 38, pp. 82-92, (2017); Booth N., Matic J.A., Mapping and leveraging influencers in social media to shape corporate brand perceptions, Corporate Communications, 16, 3, pp. 184-191, (2011); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Campbell C., Evans N.J., The role of a companion banner and sponsorship transparency in recognizing and evaluating article-style native advertising, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 43, pp. 17-32, (2018); Chae J., Explaining females' envy toward SMIs, Media Psychology, 21, 2, pp. 246-262, (2018); Choi D., Bang H., Wojdynski B.W., Lee Y.I., Keib K.M., How brand disclosure timing and brand prominence influence consumer's intention to share branded entertainment content, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 42, pp. 18-31, (2018); Cocker H., Cronon J., Charismatic authority and the YouTuber: Unpacking the new cults of personality, Marketing Theory, 17, 4, pp. 455-472, (2017); Creswell J., Millennials' lust for makeup driving a boom in the cosmetics industry, (2017); East R., Romaniuk J., Chawdhary R., Uncles M., The impact of word of mouth on intention to purchase currently used and other brands, International Journal of Market Research, 59, pp. 321-334, (2017); East R., Uncles M.D., Romaniuk J., Lomax W., Measuring the impact of positive and negative word of mouth: A reappraisal, Australasian Marketing Journal, 24, 1, pp. 54-58, (2016); Eigenraam A.W., Eelen J., van Lin A., Verlegh P.W.J., A consumer-based taxonomy of digital consumer engagement practices, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 44, pp. 102-121, (2018); Eshbaugh-Soha M., McGauvran R., Presidential leadership, the news media, and income inequality, Political Research Quarterly, 71, 1, pp. 157-171, (2018); Freberg K., Graham K., McGaughey K., Freberg L.A., Who are the SMIs?

The purpose of this paper is twofold: to categorize shared beliefs that can be obstacles for social marketing programmes and to identify the main sources of those shared beliefs. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach was used to examine the specific case of Type 1 diabetes. In-depth interviews with 12 experts and focus groups with 17 adults who had been living with Type 1 diabetes for five years or more were performed. The information was analysed applying thematic analysis. Findings: The results indicated that there are two types of shared beliefs that can hinder social marketing efforts (misconceptions and ideological convictions) and three main influencers (primary groups, communication media and authority figures). Practical implications: Target audiences can be segmented by their shared beliefs, and a specific message could be designed to reach each group. Social implications: Obstacles that could prevent the audience from engaging in a desired positive behaviour could be identified. Originality/value: To the author’s knowledge, this is the first study that uses social representations to categorize erroneous shared beliefs that could be barriers for impacting behaviours, as well as the first to identify the main sources of those beliefs. This approach could provide guidelines for the design of social marketing campaigns that could achieve better public engagement. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Health promotion programmes; Shared beliefs; Social marketing; Social representations theory; Type 1 diabetes","","","","","","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia","An earlier version of this research was presented at the 5th World Social Marketing Conference in Washington D.C., May 2017.

This has also given rise to micro-influencers, who generate content and gradually form a community following and interacting with their social accounts. Micro-influencers differ with traditional celebrities in that the latter become renown through sporting, art or the like (De Veirman et al. 2017). Micro-influencers are perceived as more reflective of their followers (Jin et al. 2019), and are argued to wield powerful influence over consumer choice, despite their much less popularity and followings than traditional celebrities (Boerman 2020). This study examines the relationships among social communication variables relating to micro-influencers on social platforms: online opinion leadership (OOL) and parasocial interaction (PSI) as personal and interpersonal source characteristics, respectively (Sweeney et al. 2008); message quality as a message characteristic (Le et al. 2020); online interaction propensity (OIP) as a receiver characteristic (Labrecque 2014); and consumer engagement behaviours (CEBs) as responses with respect to product review elements including the content, the micro-influencer, and the product/ brand embedded in the post (Casaló et al. 2020). An online survey was conducted with a convenience sample of Vietnamese consumers who have previously purchased or planned to buy a mobile phone within 6 months and have viewed online reviews about mobile phones as part of their information search. A valid data of 371 responses was analysed using smartPLS 3.3.3. Findings reveal that OOL and PSI have significant impact on message quality (p &lt; 0.05), which in turn affects significantly CEBs (p &lt; 0.05): Intention to interact with the post; intention to follow advice of the micro-influencer; and intention to recommend the micro-influencer to others. While the result only finds OIP elevates the impact of message quality on consumers’ intention to interact with the post at p &lt; 0.10; findings show significant direct impact of OIP on CEBs, though not hypothesised. This research contributes to communication literature concerning consumers’ processing of persuasive cues and information exposed to them through the online environment. The research highlights the importance of essential factors requiring attention in micro-influencer marketing: OOL, PSI, message quality and OIP. The study also contributes to consumer engagement literature with evidence concerning the focal object as micro-influencers’ online product reviews. Practically, insights from this research suggest marketers need to detect micro-influencers, target them with appropriate communication strategies so as to influence their generated and disseminated content. Marketers can take the findings of effects on intention with the post and intention to recommend the micro-influencers in approaching micro-influencers for a win-win collaboration. The study also demonstrates OIP as an important individual trait in segmenting consumers for effective consumer engagement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Consumer engagement; Micro-influencer; Online interaction propensity; Online product reviews; Opinion leadership; Parasocial interaction","","","","","","","","","T.A.

The study is based on 20 in-depth interviews with foodie Instagrammers. Findings demonstrate that unlike other communities of practice, rather than competing among themselves, foodies learn from each other, exchange tips, help those starting out in the field and attend events together. Close collaboration also leads to the formation of strong friendship bonds. However, findings show that whilst authenticity of content is deemed important, elements of influencer engagement are artificially orchestrated within their own community of practice. These findings have implications for marketing professionals in terms of evaluating influencersʻ engagement authenticity and the selection criteria they consider with regard to targeting appropriate and specific influencers to work with. © 2022 The Author(s).

Smith School of Business and Economics, CSU Channel Islands, Camarillo, CA, United States","Consumers use social media to create content, generate online word-of-mouth, and communicate with brands and other consumers. Consumers engage with influencers who deliver content that is timely, entertaining, and interesting to them. Many influencers have a truly global following across the world. However, there is little research on international aspects of social media influencers. Our paper leverages Hofstede’s cultural dimensions to study consumer engagement using a novel dataset of global sustainability influencers. Our results indicate that the cultural distance between the influencer and the followers is an important driver of engagement in a nuanced way. While the level of superficial, light engagement is not affected by the cultural distance between an influencer and her followers, the level of deep engagement increases when an influencer and her followers are culturally close. The effect is more pronounced for followers in countries where environmental concerns are considered more important. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Hofstede cultural dimensions; influencers; online wom; Social media; sustainability","","","","","","","","Agrawal D., Effect of brand loyalty on advertising and trade promotions: A game theoretic analysis with empirical evidence, Marketing Science, 15, 1, pp. 86-108, (1996); Al-Emadi F.A., Ben Yahia I., Ordinary celebrities related criteria to harvest fame and influence on social media, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 14, 2, pp. 195-213, (2020); Ashley C., Tuten T., Creative strategies in social media marketing: An exploratory study of branded social content and consumer engagement, Psychology & Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Audrezet A., de Kerviler G., Moulard J.G., Authenticity under threat: When social media influencers need to go beyond self-presentation, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 557-569, (2020); Banerjee S., Chai L., Effect of individualism on online user ratings: Theory and evidence, Journal of Global Marketing, 32, 5, pp. 377-398, (2019); Beauchemin M., 17 celebrities who actively work to protect the environment, (2017); Bonnevie E., Rosenberg S.D., Kummeth C., Goldbarg J., Wartella E., Smyser J., Using social media influencers to increase knowledge and positive attitudes toward the flu vaccine, PLoS One, 15, 10, (2020); Brodie R.J., Ilic A., Juric B., Hollebeek L., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: An exploratory analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 105-114, (2013); Bruning E., Saqib N.U., Cultural similarity and national bias: An assessment in an international service context, Journal of Global Marketing, 26, 1, pp. 41-56, (2013); Chan T.S., Chan K.K., Leung L., How consumer ethnocentrism and animosity impair the economic recovery of emerging markets, Journal of Global Marketing, 23, 3, pp. 208-225, (2010); Chang S.C., Wang C.C., Kuo C.-Y., Social media influencer research: An bibliometric analysis, International Journal of Electronic Commerce Studies, 11, 2, pp. 75-86, (2020); Chu C., Nistor C., Pehlivan E., Yalcin T., (2021); Cialdini R.B., The science of persuasion, Scientific American, 284, 2, pp. 76-81, (2001); Croswell A., (2013); Crotts J.C., Erdmann R., Does national culture influence consumers’ evaluation of travel services?

Motivating factors, including entertainment, information seeking, reward and social interaction, are regarded as antecedents of consumers' OLT, as manifested by CIEB dimensions, including consumption, contribution and creation, and subsequently drive consumer engagement with the endorsed brands. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to Malaysian social media users. A total of 263 responses were collected and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the impact of motivational factors on CIEBs. Findings: The results show that the three dimensions of CIEBs can be predicted by different gratifications (information seeking, entertainment, reward and interaction). In addition, two of the CIEB dimensions, consumption and contribution, were found to have a significant positive influence on consumers' engagement with endorsed brands. Practical implications: This study provides insights into how social media influencers (SMIs) could lead to CIEBs by creating entertaining and rewarding content that facilitates social interaction between consumers. SMIs and marketers that encourage consumers to browse, comment and share SMI-created posts will enhance consumer engagement with the endorsed brands, as engagement is driven by the consumption and contribution to SMI-created content. Originality/value: SMI marketing is increasing, and many brands are beginning to rely more on SMIs to promote brands. Yet, there is a dearth of studies that have examined how SMIs play a role in affecting consumers' engagement with endorsed brands. This study contributes to the marketing literature by developing and empirically testing the research model. Results suggest that social interaction, reward and entertainment are key motivational factors that drive CIEBs, which, in turn, foster consumer engagement with endorsed brands. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COBRAs;
